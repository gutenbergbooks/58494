THE MANUFACTURE OF ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS.

THE manufacture of artificial flowers, first brought to a high degree of
excellence by the Italians, is one of no small importance, considering
the amount of skill and labor which it brings into requisition. The first
attempt at making artificial flowers among civilized nations was by
twisting ribbons of different colors somewhat into the shape of flowers,
and fastening them to wire stems. This yielded to the use of feathers,
which were far more elegant, but could not always be made to imitate
in color the flowers which they represented, there being considerable
difficulty in getting them to take the dyes. Where the plumage of birds is
of great brilliancy, the natural colors admirably answer the purpose, and
do not fade or lose their resplendent hues. Thus, in South America, the
savages have long known how to fabricate beautiful artificial flowers from
such plumage. In Italy, the cocoons of silkworms are often used, and have
a soft and velvety appearance, while they take a brilliant dye. In France,
the finest cambric is the chief material, while wax is also largely
employed. The arrangement of the workshop, and the variety and use of
tools, where flower-making is practised on a large scale, are as follows:--

[Illustration: Fig. 1.]

A large and well-lighted room, which has the means of warmth in winter,
is selected, and along its whole extent is placed a table, similar to the
writing-tables used in schools, where the work-people may have a good
light as long as possible. This table is fitted with drawers containing
numerous compartments, arranged so as to receive and keep separate the
small parts of flowers, such as petals, stalks, minute blossoms catkins,
buds, leaves not mounted on their stalks and all other parts not fit to
be placed among more finished specimens. It is desirable that the table
be covered with oil-cloth, so that it may be frequently cleansed, by
washing, from the stains of the different colors employed. Along the whole
extent of this table are placed flower-holders, that is, light frames
with horizontal iron wires, to which the flowers, when attached to their
stalks, are suspended by merely crooking the end of the stalk, and hanging
it on the wire. Sometimes tightly strained pack-thread is used instead
of wire. Figs. 1 and 2 represent two forms of flower-holder; in both
cases the frame is fixed to the table. Along the tables are also ranged
bobbin-holders in considerable numbers, not unlike those used by weavers.
The bobbin-holder is a rod of iron, Fig. 3, about six inches high, fixed
in a massive leaden or wooden base. On this rod is threaded a large
bobbin, on which is wound a quantity of silk or wool. On its summit may
be fixed a nut, to prevent the bobbin, when in rapid motion, from whirling
off the rod, but this is often omitted. Ladies who work for their pleasure
frequently have this bobbin-holder made in an ornamental form, the base
being covered with bas-reliefs, and the nut at the top taking the form of
an arrow, a blossom, &c. But the more simple and free from ornament, the
better is the holder for use, any unnecessary projections only acting as
so many means of entangling the silk.

[Illustration: Fig. 2.]

[Illustration: Fig. 3.]

The flower-maker does not take up flowers or their parts with the
fingers, but with pincers of the simplest description, Fig. 4, which
are incessantly in use. With these, the smallest parts of the flower
can be seized, and disposed in their proper places, raised, depressed,
turned about and adjusted, according to the taste of the artist, and her
appreciation of natural forms. It is with the pincers also that any little
contortions of the extremities of petals, and irregularities in their
form and in the arrangement of stamens, are copied. The proper length of
this tool is about five inches. Each workwoman brings one for her own
use, and keeps it close at hand. Dressing-frames of various sizes form
another part of the furniture of the work-room. On these are stretched the
materials, which are gummed and dyed. A dressing-frame, Fig. 5, consists
of two uprights of hard wood, with two cross pieces of the same, capable
of adjustment. The frame is fitted with crooks for the attachment of the
material, or with a band of coarse canvas to which the material can be
sewn. These frames have no feet, and are fitted sometimes against a wall,
sometimes upon a chair. When covered with the material, they are hung up
against the wall by one of the cross pieces, until it is time to dismount
them.

[Illustration: Fig. 8.]

There are also various useful implements, called by the work-people
"irons," for cutting out petals, calyxes, and bracts, and for giving to
leaves those various serrated and other forms which produce such wonderful
variety in foliage. These cutting tools, two of which are shown in Figs.
6 and 7, are of iron, with a hollow handle, flat at its upper extremity,
that the hammer may be readily applied. They are about four or five inches
long, and of numerous sizes and varieties. That they may cut rapidly and
clearly, the edges are occasionally rubbed with dry soap. When a leaf
becomes attached to the interior, and cannot be shaken out, a little
ring of wire, Fig. 8, is introduced in a hole _j_, Fig. 7, left for that
purpose to disengage it. The material is doubled several times under the
cutter, so that several petals or leaves may be cut out at once. The block
on which the leaves are cut out is rather a complicated affair. It is
placed near a window, and as far as possible from the workers, that the
blows of the hammer may not interfere with their employment. Sometimes
it consists of a very stout framework of timber, on which is placed a
mattress of straw to deaden the blows, and upon this mattress a thick
smooth piece of lead, forming a square table, Fig. 9. In some cases a
solid block of timber is used, a portion of the trunk of a tree taken near
the root, and on this the mattress and the leaden table are placed. The
hammers used at this work are short and heavy; one is especially adapted
for smoothing the surface of the lead when it becomes indented all over by
the blows of the workman.

The cutting out of the leaves and petals is only a preliminary operation
to the more perfect imitation of nature; the leaves must next be gauffered
to represent the veins, the fold, and the endless touches and indentations
which are found in the natural plant. Gauffering is executed in two ways,
the first and simplest being that which merely gives the hollow form
to the petals of roses, cherry-blossoms, peach, hawthorn, and numerous
other flowers which preserve, until the period of decay, somewhat of the
form of a bud, all the petals beautifully curving inwards. To imitate
these, the gauffering tools are simple polished balls of iron fixed on
iron rods, with a wooden handle attached, as shown in Fig. 10. The balls
are of various sizes, from a pin's head upwards, to adapt them to the
minute blossoms of such flowers as the forget-me-not, which require only
the slightest degree of curvature, and to the large flowers of camelia,
dahlia, mallow, &c., where the curvature is of often very great. These
balls are made slightly warm, so as to fix the forms decidedly, without
effacing the colors. The petals are placed on a cushion, and the iron is
pressed against them. But curvature alone is not sufficient; there is, in
many petals, a decided fold or plait up the centre, springing from the
point where it is attached to the germen. This fold can be obtained by the
use of a prism-shaped iron, Fig. 11. Conical, cylindrical, and hooked
irons, Figs. 12, 13, are also useful to imitate the various minutiæ of the
blossoms. A cushion near each artist serves as a rest to the gauffering
irons, which must be preserved from the least taint of dust, seeing that
they are applied to the most delicately-beautiful portions of the flower.
The veins and curves of leaves are given by gauffers composed of two
distinct parts, on each of which is severally moulded in copper the upper
and under surface of the leaf as shown in Fig. 14. Sometimes, one part
is of iron, the other of copper. It is necessary to have a very large
assortment of these gauffers; in fact, they should correspond in number
with the cutting-irons by which the forms of leaves are punched out. The
leaf or leaves being inserted in the gauffer, a powerful pressure is given
to stamp the desired form. This is accomplished either by means of a heavy
iron pressed on the lid, or by two or three smart blows of a hammer, or,
better still, by the uniform action of a press, such as is shown in Fig.
15. Besides the above articles, the workshop is provided with an abundance
of boxes, scissors large and small, for cutting wire, as well as textile
fabrics, camel-hair pencils, sponges, canvas-bags, &c., that everything
likely to be needed by the work-people may be immediately at hand.

[Illustration: Fig. 14.]

[Illustration: Fig. 15.]

The material of which flowers are made is, first and best (as already
stated), French cambric, but a great quantity of Scotch cambric, jaconet,
and even fine calico, are also used. For some descriptions of flowers,
clear muslin, crape, and gauze, are wanted; and for some very thick
petals, satin and velvet are necessary. These materials are provided in
various colors, as well as in white, but fresh tints have frequently to
be given. These are laid on with a sponge, or a camel-hair pencil, or
the petal is dipped in color; a quantity of green taffeta should always
be at hand for leaves. The coloring matters used in dyeing the material
for the petals are as follows: For red, in its various shades, _Brazil
wood_ is largely used, also carmine, lake, and carthamus. The best way
of treating Brazil wood is to macerate it cold in alcohol for several
days; a little salt of tartar, potash, or soap, will make this color pass
into purple; a little alum gives it a fine crimson-red, and an acid will
make it pass into yellow, of which the shade is deeper according to the
quantity employed. Carmine is better in lumps than in powder; diffused
in pure water, it gives rose-color; a little salt of tartar brightens
the tint. Carthamus is dissolved cold in alcohol; heat, as well as the
alkalies, causes it to pass to orange. The acids render it of a lively and
pure red; a very delicate flesh-color is obtained by rinsing the material,
colored with carthamus, in slightly soapy water. Blue colors are prepared
by means of indigo, or Prussian blue. Sometimes balls of common blue are
used, steeped in water. Indigo is first dissolved in sulphuric acid. This
is then diluted with water, and powdered chalk or whiting is added until
effervescence ceases. The liquor is afterwards decanted off, and the
sediment, when washed, gives a paler color. Greater intensity is given
to indigo by adding a little potash. Yellow colors are given by turmeric
dissolved in spirits of wine, by saffron, chrome-yellow, &c. Green colors
are obtained by mixtures of blue and yellow; violets, by mixtures of red
and blue, and by archil and a blue bath; lilacs, by archil only.

The method of making a rose will give a good idea of the manufacture
in general. First of all, the petals are cut out from the finest and
most beautiful cambric. The pattern-shapes must be of different sizes,
because, in the same rose, the petals are never equal; a good assortment
of patterns enables the artist the better to imitate the variety of
nature. When the petals are thus prepared, they have to be dyed in a bath
of carmine in alkaline water. For this purpose, they are held separately
by means of pincers, and dipped first in the bath, and then into pure
water, to give them that delicacy of tint which is characteristic of the
rose. But as the color of the petal usually deepens towards the centre,
a tint is there laid on with the pencil, while a drop of water is laid
on the point of insertion of the petal, to make the color there fade off,
as it does in nature, to white. If the right tint is not given at first,
the processes are repeated; any slight imperfection, such as is seen in
the petals of most living flowers, being also accurately imitated with
the pencil. The taffeta employed in making leaves is dyed of the proper
green in the piece before cutting out. It is then stretched out to dry,
and afterwards further prepared with gum-arabic on one side, to represent
the glossy upper surface of leaves, and with starch on the other, to give
the velvety appearance of the under side. This preparation, colored to
suit the exact shade to be given to the leaf, must be just of the proper
consistence, making the leaf neither too stiff nor too limp, while it
gives the proper kind of under surface. Where the leaf requires a marked
degree of this velvet texture, it is given by the nap of cloth reduced
to fine powder, and properly tinted. A little gum is lightly passed over
the surface, and when partly dry, this powder is dusted over it, the
superfluous portion being shaken off. These preparations having been
completed, it yet remains to give to the leaves, after they are cut out,
the appearance of nature, by representing the veins and indentations which
they always exhibit. For this purpose various gauffering-tools are made
use of.

The material for the leaflets of the calyx in roses, is subjected to
another process immediately on coming out of the dye, in order to preserve
the firmness which it is necessary the calyx should have. To this end,
the taffeta, while still damp, is impregnated with colored starch on
both sides, and stretched on the drying-frame: when perfectly dry, the
leaflets are cut out according to pattern. Buds are made also of taffeta,
or, if partially open, they are made of white kid tinted of a suitable
color, stuffed with cotton, or crumb of bread, and tied firmly with silk
to slender wires. The stamens are prepared by attaching to a little knot
of worsted a sufficient quantity of ends of silk to form the heart of the
flower. These ends of silk, cut to the proper length, are then stiffened
in kid jelly, and, when dry, the extremities are slightly moistened with
gum-arabic and dipped in a preparation of wheaten flour, colored yellow,
to represent the pollen. Each thread takes up its separate grain, and is
left to dry. The heart of the flower being thus prepared, and fixed to a
stem of wire, the smaller petals are arranged round it, and fixed by paste
at their points. The larger petals succeed, some of which are hollowed or
wrinkled, while constant care is taken to give them a natural appearance
in disposing them around the centre. The calyx comes next, and incloses
the ends of all the petals. It is fixed with paste, and surrounded with
more or less of cotton thread, which also generally incloses one or more
wires attached to that which bears the heart of the flower, and forming
the germ. The whole is covered with silver-paper tinted green. The leaves
are mounted on copper wire, and are arranged on the stem in the order
which nature teaches, the covering of cotton and tissue-paper hiding the
joints.

In addition to the manufacture of flowers intended as closely as possible
to represent their living models, there is a large branch of the art
in which the aim seems to be to depart from nature as far as possible.
These _fancy flowers_ are the fruit of the artist's peculiar taste,
and are therefore as impossible to describe as we sincerely wish they
were impossible to execute. There are also flowers of natural forms,
but of unnatural colors, being made to assume mournful hues to suit the
circumstances of their wearers. There are also gold and silver flowers,
more resplendent, but equally unnatural. Of these, sometimes the stamens
and pistils alone are metallic; sometimes the petals are gilded, and
sometimes the leaves and fruit glitter in the same precious metal. An easy
method of applying the gilt in any device or form, is to prepare a cement
which shall fix it to the cambric, paper, or other material (this cement
may be honey and gum-arabic boiled in beer), and then to moisten with it
the surface, placing thereon rather more gold-leaf than is necessary to
cover it, pressing it down with a cotton rubber, and, when it is dry,
rubbing off the superfluous gilding with the same.

Flowers are also made in chenille, but do not pretend to an accurate
imitation of nature. There are two or three methods of making them, the
simplest being to represent merely the shapes of flowers; for instance,
apple-blossoms, represented by small loops of pink chenille arranged round
a centre. Another method is, to make out the distinct petals, by rows of
chenille placed close together. A third and prettier method, is that of
uniting chenille with ordinary flower-making. Flowers made of feathers
may be extremely rich and brilliant in their effect. Yet ordinarily
feather-flowers are more difficult than satisfactory, and there are very
few of our own familiar flowers that can be successfully copied by them.
One of the best imitations is that of the wild clematis when adorned, as
it is in autumn, with its plumed seeds. These can be admirably imitated
in white marabout feathers. Some of the most available feathers for
flower-making are those found under the wings of young pigeons.

The manufacture of wax-flowers is carried on by using the purest virgin
wax, entirely freed from all extraneous matters. Wax that is either
granular or friable must be rejected. It is generally melted in vessels
of tinned iron, copper, or earthenware. To render it ductile, fine Venice
turpentine, white, pure, and of an agreeable odor, is added. The mixture
is constantly stirred with a glass or wooden spatula. All contact with
iron must be avoided, and if the vessels are of that material, they must
be well and carefully tinned. When stiff leaves are to be executed, two
parts of spermaceti are added to eight parts of wax, to give transparency.
Much care and tact are needed in coloring the wax. The colors being in
fine powder, are made into a paste by adding little by little of essence
of citron or lavender. When the trituration is perfect, this paste is
mixed with melted wax, stirring rapidly all the while; and while the mass
is still liquid, it is poured into moulds of pasteboard, or tinned iron,
of the shape of tablets, and is then ready for use. Sometimes it is passed
through fine muslin as it flows into the moulds. Another method is, to
tie up the color in a muslin bag, and wave it about amongst the molten
wax until the desired tint is obtained. To combine colors, it is only
necessary to have two or three bags containing different colors, and to
employ as much of each as shall have the desired effect. These bags, far
from being spoiled by dipping in wax already containing other shades, have
only to be rinsed in pure water to fit them for coloring other wax. The
colors most in use in wax flower-making, are pure forms of white-lead,
vermilion, lake, and carmine, ultramarine, cobalt, indigo, and Prussian
blue, chrome, Naples yellow, and yellow ochre. Greens and violets are
chiefly made from mixtures of the above.

The wax being prepared, the manufacture of flowers is carried on in two
ways. The first consists in steeping in liquid wax little wooden moulds
rinsed with water, around which the wax forms in a thin layer, so as to
take the form of the mould, and thus to present, when detached from it,
the appearance of the whole or part of a flower. In this way lilac and
other simple blossoms are obtained with much rapidity. The branches are
also executed with wax softened by heat, and moulded with the fingers
round a thread of wire. As for leaves and petals, they are cut out of
sheets of colored wax of the proper thickness. These sheets are glossy
on one side, and velvety on the other. To express the veining of
leaves, they are placed in moistened moulds, and pressed with the thumb
sufficiently to get the impression, which is accurately copied from
nature. The petals are made to adhere simply by pressure; the leaves are
placed on a little footstalk, and the latter fastened to the stem. The
manner of procuring moulds for the accurate imitation of leaves, is as
follows: A natural leaf of the plant it is wished to imitate is spread
out on a flat surface of marble, for example. It is lightly but equally
greased with olive oil, and surrounded with a wall of wax, which must not
touch it. Then, in a small vessel containing a few spoonfuls of water,
a few pinches of plaster of Paris are to be thrown, and briskly stirred
till the liquid has the consistence of thick cream. This is poured over
the leaf, and left till it is well hardened. It is then lifted up and the
leaf detached, when it will be seen that the plaster has taken a perfect
impression of every vein and indentation. Such moulds are rendered far
more durable if they are impregnated while warm with drying oil. This
gives them greater solidity, and prevents their crumbling from frequent
immersion in water. It is necessary to impress strongly on all amateur wax
flower-makers the necessity for having all tools and moulds completely
moistened with water, otherwise the wax will be constantly adhering, and
preventing neatness of workmanship.

The variety of the materials used in artificial flower-making was
displayed to an amusing extent in the World's Fair. In addition to the
really beautiful and artistic productions already noticed, and to the
elegant flowers constructed of palm-leaves, of straw, and of shells, as
well as of all the materials named in this paper, there were flowers
fabricated in human hair, in chocolate, in soap, in wood, marble,
porcelain, common earthenware, and other unpromising materials.

ZANOTTI: A ROMANTIC TALE OF ITALY AND SPAIN.

BY PERCY.


CHAPTER I.

                          "Thou favored land
    Of art and nature, thou art still before me;
    Thy _sons_; to whom their labor is a sport,
    So well thy grateful soil returns its tribute
    Thy sunburnt daughters, with their laughing eyes
    And glossy raven locks."

    "Oh, Love, thou art a strange wild thing,
      A dancing beam of Mayday sun,
    A life-morn song that angels sing,
      A gift from Him, the Highest One!
    Thou art a _claude-tint_ thrown among
      The Rembrandt shades that limn our strife!
    The olive on thy lip is hung,
      Thou dove, that bringest words of life."
                            "_Love_," BY PERCY.

COUNT CARLO ZANOTTI was a son of one of the noblest families in
Venice--the heir of its titles, its wealth, its hereditary renown, and
his prospects in the spring of life were golden as the trees in autumn.
An incident in his father's history, which tinged the old man's declining
years with a gloomy shadow, had also its effect upon the son, and,
unmindful of the brilliant future, he brooded in sadness on the past. His
mother, who was the beauty of her day, had yielded to the fascinations
of a young and handsome Englishman, and in an unguarded moment left
her home and her husband, to throw herself upon the poor protection
of a profligate, and to meet the cold sneers and savage slights of a
selfish and unforgiving world. _How much_ the character, in its gradual
development, is biased by a mother's influence, it is difficult to
estimate; but we all know that "_the thought which mirrors Eden in the
face of home_" has saved even the _best_ of us from many an error and
many a sin, and generated, even in the _worst_, some softening emotions,
and caused some kindly acts. This holy influence, linked with a mother's
memory, makes each thought of her, as the German beautifully expresses it,
"a prayer to God," and we rise from musing upon her gentle love--kinder,
better, wiser. "_The wild sea of our hearts lies mute, and o'er the waves
the Saviour walks._" How terrible then to have that sanctuary defiled, to
be taught that purity has fled, even from Dian's temple--_to be brought up
an atheist in the religion of the heart_!

Calm, gentle, passionless in outward aspect, the count became noted as
an earnest scholar, and yet his heart contained many a hidden stratum of
volcanic passion, which burned scathingly at the thought of his mother's
shame! From an intense consciousness that the conduct of his parent
entailed its measure of reproach upon himself, he shrank from the society
of men, and sought sources of relaxation in tracing to their sequences
those great thoughts which the thinkers of all time, in their debasement
and their exaltation, have written down and immortalized--some, on the
undying page; some, on the living canvas; some, on the ever-moving
firmament of ceaseless action! The shadow of the wing of time fell upon
_him_ as a man, at an age when most of us are immature, unthinking boys.
_The epochs of strong natures_ are dialed upon the mind not by the
sunshine but by the darkness of the heart! Our sorrows are the evil genii
who transform in a moment boyhood to manhood, and manhood to age!

Every day, every hour, this young man acquired something from ancient or
from modern lore; at twenty-four he was versed in a learning beyond that
of many a lifelong scholar. His studies, within a year of the period at
which we introduce him to the reader, had taken a form different from any
he had before pursued; the old disciples of a gorgeous mythology being
neglected for the mystical and alluring spiritualism of the exponents of
modern German philosophy. The English philosophy is entirely destructive
of the grand, the lofty, the divine! It lowers and debases by its
precepts, and chills by its explanations. The French, on the other hand,
attempts no explanations; but the system is an elaborate sneer at all that
is good, and true, and high, and noble. The aim of the German "is at least
the nobler one, and elevates, not dwarfs, the souls of men." "There is a
Godlike within us that feels itself akin to the God; and if we are told
that both the 'Godlike and the God are dreams,' we can but answer that so
to dream is better than to wake and find ourselves nothing!"

Who among us--but worms of the dust, low things, fit only for the mire
in which they wallow--but has at one time or another demanded initiation
into the secret order of the "searchers after truth?" Who among us but,
unsatisfied with the knowledge that may be achieved, grasps wildly after
heaven's thunderbolts, and would embrace the unattainable, feeling, as we
so terribly do, the restlessness and the might of the Deity in our burning
veins? Who among us but has tried to look deep into the future, and read
the fate, not of the next year or moment, but of the undying spirit in
that other world, of which we dream so much, and know so little?

And who among us who has had the heroism honestly to make the attempt,
and to pursue to their sequences the terrible thoughts to which such
reflection gives rise, but has gone down headlong to the pit? If no
_actual_ phantoms haunt the waking dreams of such unsuccessful neophytes,
yet a more terrible thing is that accursed skepticism--that coldness
that does not brook to be questioned, and that cannot be understood--that
fills his soul. It does not come over his hours of mirth, when the
wine-cup passes and the jest goes round; but, like the fabled fiend of the
romancers, comes only over the lost one's soul, when his intellect would
aspire and his genius dare. Comes it, with its eternal sneer, that sees
nothing so high that it does not make it appear utterly despicable! When
his genius would dare, comes it with its evil eyes, and he loses faith in
his genius and doubts his power; loses faith when he knows that faith only
can bear him through life's tempests; doubts while he feels doubt to be
the unpardonable sin.[1]

Count Zanotti had passed through each of the stages of which I
speak--first, an unquenchable yearning for forbidden knowledge; next,
the rapture that glows when the lip touches the sparkle on the brim of
the cup--and then the flatness and the weariness that follow! But for
_him_, there was yet a hope. His heart had never beat with the quick pulse
of love! Its youthful vigor was unimpaired, and in a contest with the
intellect there was strong hope of it proving victorious. The struggle
came soon enough.

CHAPTER II.

    "Two souls with but a single thought,
    Two hearts that beat as one."--INGOMAR.

AT the end of the long, gloomy day following the conclusion of the
carnival, Zanotti accompanied his father to a midnight mass, and there
for the first time saw Leonora D'Alvarez, the daughter of Spain's
ambassador to the court of the winged Lion of St. Mark's. She was one
of those beautiful creations that we so often dream of, and sigh for,
and sometimes, but very seldom, see. _Soul_ there shed its spiritual
attributes over one from whose features even the bloom of youth seemed to
catch a brighter hue. Like all Italians, Zanotti had dreamed of love--the
love of the poet and the dreamer; and now he felt it in its strength--the
love of a pure, unselfish, yet deep and ardent nature!

To shorten a long story (for we must leave much to be divined in this
history), he felt the inspiration growing out of love impelling him to
give him his feelings to the world in immortal song. He wrote, and he
became famous! Then, when a nation bowed before his genius--when a world
re-echoed his name with reverence--he sought the woman who had roused his
soul to exertion; he told her that he loved her; he told her that all
the bright thoughts and sparkling fancies the _universe_ had claimed as
its own were hers--all hers; that she, and she alone, had made his name
as deathless as the ethereal essence the Almighty had endowed his body
with--and that unless she gave still another gift--_her heart_--fame,
fortune, name, genius--were but empty, and hollow, and useless!

The whispered reply was no denying one, and he seemed to have attained
all of happiness the world can offer. Months flew by--months in which
life seemed born, like Venus, "of a rosy sea and a drop from heaven;"
months when each to-morrow hung an "arch of promise," a ladder of
sunlight, each round of which seemed made to lead the feet through
Ivan gardens--up--up towards the sky! The glorious sun, warming like a
lover's glance the beautiful bosom of the "Doge's bride"--the swelling
"Adriatic"--the churches, the palaces, the prisons, whose gloom was
hallowed by romantic memories, the legends attached to the palatial home
of his own proud sires--these were subjects upon which, all the livelong
day, he could expatiate, and she delightedly listen; and when night stole
like a dream through the soft atmosphere, the stars, with their Chaldaic
interpretations, furnished a new page from whence he could cull prophecies
of their fate! Then would he weave old superstitions with the fancies of
the poet and the lover, till he grew amazed at his own strange eloquence!

She, too, on her part, had an exhaustless theme in telling how, by
degrees, _his_ soul had, as it were, become a part of hers; how every
emotion in his own mind, by an imperceptible and view-less magnetism,
awakened hers to action. The simplest speech had a charm for him; there
was music in her voice; her thoughts were dimless mirrors reflecting the
spirituality of her soul; to use his own language, "each word was the
spray of her heart, which mirrored in its sparkling globule all the beauty
and none of the defects of the world around it!" The days glided by upon
the swift pinions lent by unclouded happiness.

They lived in an atmosphere where all was of the past, save their love
and their hopes; the multitude of traffickers and idlers that crossed
their daily path were as unheeded shadows; they mingled only with beings
of other times. Their friends--for the friends of the scholar became
those of the maiden--were Homer and Virgil, Tasso and Marino, the graceful
Catullus, and the rough, but noble-tongued Lucretius! They strolled in
imagination through Ilion's Scæn gate, along the luxuriant banks of her
winding rivers, and lay down to repose beneath her wild and broad-leaved
fig-tree. And then, when they had gathered around them the heroes and the
poets of past and buried ages, unlike Alaric, they would weigh the myrtle
crown against the laurel wreath, and see glory kick the beam!

Could year after year of their lives have rolled away with such feelings
and amid such employments, they would have indeed been blessed! But no!
Alas! that could not be! Love, and youth, and hope, are but the sun-fringe
of the cloud of life, the flame that gilds the bark it consumes, the
lightning flashes that foretell a rent and shattered heart! For love,
if no outward influences assail (or assailing, are conquered and driven
back), there is custom, that slow, insidious lullaby, singing in Morphean
tones unceasingly, till, wearied and overcome, _that_ passion, that would
have repelled a visible foe, sinks at his post in quietness--asleep!

It came! It burst upon them without a warning! Fate had suspended a
sword above their heads; but, unlike the tyrant's envious favorite, they
saw it not ere it fell! It came--crushing and blighting the flowers
that had blossomed for them, and, tearing their young hearts from the
beautiful dream-world in which they revelled, brought them back to the
harsh and dull and cold realities of this! The father of the lover was
suddenly arrested by the myrmidons of the terrible Council of Ten. It was
discovered he was the head of a wide-spread conspiracy against the state,
and the expiration of the month of his arrest saw the noble and powerful
family of Zanotti exiles--its lord sent forth with the boon of life, but
with ruined fortunes and a tarnished name--its heir an outcast, though
spotless of a single crime.

The parting of the lovers was brief and terrible. _She_ swore to him that
death only should take the bloom from her love, that, ruined in name and
fortune as he was, he was, as ever, the high priest of her heart's temple,
and that no other could ever approach its altar. _He_ offered _no vows_,
but said to her, that if five years sped by without his presence, to deem
him dead, and know he had died in striving to win laurels worthy to lay
before her father's daughter!

       *       *       *       *       *


CHAPTER III.

YEARS passed, and in a foreign land Alfieri sought to win wealth and a
new name to offer the idol of his heart. He succeeded beyond his wildest
hopes, and with an impatience that would have been unsatisfied with the
swiftness of the lightning, sped over the waters, in a richly freighted
argosy of his own, back to his native city of the "Siren Sea."

Trusty adherents of his house had, in the mean time, procured the
reversion of the attainder as far as it touched him, and, as his father
was no longer alive, there was a strong prospect of his estate being
restored to him.

Arrived at Venice, he learned that the Duke D'Alvarez had been recalled,
and in the course of conversation the new ambassador mentioned that there
was talk in Madrid of a projected nuptial between the Donna Leonora and
the Prince Carlos of the blood royal of Spain.

Zanotti's lip quivered, and his eye flashed fiercely as he heard the
rumor, but not a word escaped to betray the hot feelings that were
pressing at his heart. Ere the sun sank into his bed of rosy clouds that
night, his gallant ship, with straining masts and every stitch of canvas
set, was speeding, like a gull, over the waters, and Zanotti paced the
deck through that night and the next with a stride that betokened troubled
thoughts. He reached Madrid in safety, and lost no time in finding the
residence of the ambassador. There were bright lights flitting from
window to window, and the sound of music was borne upon the night-wind,
betokening revelry within. He stopped to question a lackey who was
lounging at the entrance.

"The Donna Leonora was married this night three weeks ago, and Monseignor
gives a feast to-night to his son-in-law, the prince!"

Zanotti clutched one of the pillars that supported the massive doorway,
and kept his hold for a moment convulsively, for he felt his limbs
failing him. This movement brought his face beneath the jet of a lighted
chandelier, and the servant shrank with affright--it was like the
countenance of the dead! Terrible as was the struggle in his breast;
fearful as was the sudden contest of passion and despair; lost as he was
to aught but a blighting sense of the wreck and desolation of his hopes,
he still could not be oblivious to the significantly curious glance of the
affrighted servant. By an almost superhuman effort he repressed further
show of feeling, and his voice was without a particle of tremulousness,
although very hollow, as he told the menial to announce "General di
Romano." Such was his new rank and name! Many a fair dame started as that
tall, majestic figure, with its proud head and features, pale and rigid
as if hewn from the quarries of Pentelicus, passed her, as straight he
proceeded to the extremity of the apartment, where, in a group conversing
with smiling looks, stood the Duke de la Darca, his daughter, and the
Prince Carlos of Spain. The count (or, as we should now call him, the
general), unobserved by the group, placed himself near one of the large
Gothic windows, opposite to which was a group of statuary that effectually
concealed him from view. Here he paused to gaze upon the woman who had
wrecked his happiness! Four years had passed without robbing her of a
single grace, and she stood there sparkling with diamonds, radiant with
beauty, and with a regality of bearing that well became her new and
princely station.

An hour had elapsed, and he had watched her through many a stately measure
in the pompous dances of her country, and heard her light jest and her
gay laugh, and saw the same haughty fire in her magnificent black eyes,
through all! Jealousy has often been described, and the burning words
of the poet have wrought out an appalling picture; but if, during that
hour, each wild throb of his bursting heart, if each shooting fire of
his seething brain, if the madness and the agony and the fierce black
promptings that fashioned each thought into shape, and called it _murder_!
could have been conveyed in words or upon canvas to the minds of less
volcanic natures, they would have laughed to scorn the artist or the
author, and accused him of conjuring up the Titan agonies of hell to
confine them in the contracted space afforded by the heart of a mere
mortal man!

He turned from the revellers, sick and dizzy, and gazed out upon the
night. The scene was as fair a one as God's smile ever lighted into
beauty. The moon--floating in a sea of blue, cloudless, with the exception
of one fleecy-looking mass of vapor that covered a small space like a veil
of silver tissue--poured a flood of radiance upon a garden (surrounding
the house on three sides) filled with rare exotics, and in the distance
the steeples of the city rose up towards the sky, as if formed of
luminous mist. The stars, too, were scattered round night's queen in rich
profusion, and the air was fragrant with the breath of orange-blossoms.
The Venetian, even in that land of sunshine and of flowers--his native
Italy--had never looked upon as beautiful a scene. But it suggested no
soothing fancies! It only revived the memory of hours of which it was now
madness to think! Hours that were freighted with dreams and aspirations
as lovely as itself! Hours that were passed--and forever; and aspirations
that were coffined and dead! His brain seemed bursting with the heat
of the room, and, as the window was a casement but a few feet from the
ground, he sprang out, and walked with a hasty step in a direction in
which, from a plashing sound that smote his ear, he hoped to find a
spring or fountain. He found his conjecture a correct one, and, stooping
down, laved his fevered temples in the liquid, which was as cold as ice,
but seemed ineffectual when applied to the terrible fever that consumed
him! He threw himself upon a richly sculptured seat that was supported
by two marble Dryads on the edge of the fountain, and, in spite of every
restraining effort, groaned aloud. He had remained thus for some time,
regardless of time, place, everything but a dull leaden weight of misery,
when a light footfall on the hard gravel roused him, and, springing from
his recumbent position, he was about to conceal himself amid the foliage
of the adjoining shrubbery, for he was in no mood for society just then.
He also had been heard, however, and a rich, musical voice exclaimed--

"Dear father, are you there?"

Good heaven! it was _her_ voice! He stood spell-bound--volition was
suspended. The next moment they were face to face! With a low thrilling
cry, she cast herself upon his breast. There was a gleam half of
terror--partly of surprise and partly of joy--within her eyes. There were
the two again! ay, even as of yore! Leonora and Carlo! The ruined noble
and his betrothed bride--the princess and the soldier!

       *       *       *       *       *


CHAPTER IV.

    The heart hath whispered in its bliss,
    Who could be sad in scenes like this?
    But, hist, a sound the night-wind bears,
    A voice of love and sighs and tears!
                                  _MS. Poem._

AN instant, but a single instant, the lady remained upon his breast, and
then Zanotti, removing her clinging arms, placed her upon the seat which
he had himself just occupied. She looked upon him, her full dark eyes
flowing with tears, and seemed struggling for utterance, but no words
came! At length, with an averted face, he spoke--

"Your highness forgets our relative positions, and"--

"Forgets!" said she wildly, interrupting him; "forgets! Ay! I did indeed
for a moment forget all but you; and you, Oh Carlo, is yours the voice to
bring back reality? Is it for you to whom every pulsation of my heart has
been dedicated; for whom in the long hours of night I have wept tears that
seemed of blood--is it for you to restore me to a reality which contains
no elements but those of despair, those that break hearts, those that
frenzy the exhausted brain?"

Alfieri's voice was sepulchrally hollow when he replied, and the quivering
of his manly frame showed the violence of the emotion within.

"Leonora," said he, "Leonora, four years ago we parted in Venice. I vowed
never to see you more till I had won a name you could not shame to wear;
and _you_ swore never to betray my deep devotion. I was then unacquainted
with life; I was young and trusting; I looked upon the flower and inhaled
its perfume, nor sought to analyze what hidden poisons lurked within
it; I looked not for a serpent or a viper in its folded leaves! I gazed
upon the diamond-sheeted waters, nor thought upon the noxious elements
that, uniting in malaria, might rise from their bosom to desolate many a
neighboring home. I turned my eyes upon the moonlit sky without a thought
of a possible hour when the same azure face of heaven would frown and the
live thunder launch its bolts to ruin and destroy! Ay! I _then_ looked but
at the fair _outside_ of all created things, and heeded not the motive or
the soul within! Leonora, I looked on _you_, and I believed you! I went
forth cheerfully to the hard fight I had before me; I kept my vow--I am a
field-marshal of Austria. Have you kept yours?"

She cast upon him an imploring, a piteous glance. The moon was beaming
through an interstice in the foliage and shone full upon his features,
making their paleness ghastly, but showing no _violent_ emotion--nothing
but a hushed, cold, haughty sorrow.

She trembled perceptibly as she replied to his concluding question.

"Yes, as truly as I have my faith in God; Alfieri, they told me you were
dead. Circumstances too complicated to explain placed my father in a
position with the government that involved his life. Prince Carlos saved
him, and, for the priceless service, asked but the poor repayment of my
hand. I told him my heart could not accompany the gift. He still urged his
suit. Could I refuse?"

"Ay, madam, the tale sounds well," was the bitter reply; "but your grief
seemed of a strangely merry sort; but now your laugh was as light as any
in the room, your jest as gay!"

"Zanotti!" said the lady, and there was something of indignation in her
tone, "I am not what the world in its cold carelessness deems me, and
_you_ judge me as the greatest stranger of them all would do! The face may
be wreathed in smiles, the lips may be musical with laughing jests, and
yet, in its unrevealed depths, the heart may writhe in anguish, the soul
sink with despair! But this recrimination is vain, all vain!"

She clasped her forehead as if in pain, and hot tears forced themselves
through the tightly pressed fingers. Her lover maintained a cold and
scornful silence. All the pride of his race had combined with a deep
sense of injury in a trusting and betrayed nature to make him stern and
apparently heartless in his resentment. Suddenly Leonora started to her
feet, the woman's pride within her revolted at what seemed the _silent
sarcasm_ of his look. Her eyes, with the tears checked suddenly within
them, emitted a wild, singular, startling light; there was something
of the Medusa in her aspect. She gazed at him with a strange mingling
of supplication and haughtiness in her look; her glance penetrated his
soul and softened it; he heard the panting throb of her heart, and knew
there could be no acting in that. Her breath came warm upon his cheek; he
trembled at the recollections that were crowding upon him. And then, too,
she spoke--

"You use me _too_ cruelly," she said; "I do not deserve this silent scorn!
I have wronged myself by giving way to emotions for which you but mock and
despise me!"

He started--were not her words true? Had he not been unjust in his grief?

"Leonora," said he, abruptly, "hear me! From my earliest youth--ever
since remembrance avails me to recall events--rash, impetuous feeling (my
inheritance from a long line of hot-headed ancestors) made me in every
feeling extreme and violent. I rushed to my studies as to a conflict
with a foe, and rested not till I had conquered every difficulty. The
same in pleasure, obstacles were but the stones that made the stream of
life sparkle brightly in its sun, and I leaped over them, or cast them
aside with an exulting sense of power. My love for _you_ concentrated
all this vagrant impetuosity into one earnest and undying passion. It
subdued and soothed the sinuosities of my outward nature; it checked the
headlong restlessness that was before apparent in all I did, and turned
all the various bubbling springs within me into one noiseless, but deep,
resistless stream. It made an ocean of the rivers of my being; that ocean
rose and fell, tinted with the sun's glorious beams for a brief space! Oh!
how brief! and then storms arose; and now, when I know the tempest is
to last forever, is it strange if I am indignant when I look on her who
wrought all this misery, this fearful misery?"

He had spoken without looking up at her. He now raised his eyes, and found
her again weeping bitterly.

"And do I not share that misery, with all the aggravation of a fruitless
remorse? Oh, you know not," she added, her voice assuming a tone of
beseeching earnestness, "the days and nights of intense anguish that
dragged their slow length along, when thinking you lay beneath the deep
sea (for they said your grave was there). When tears would flow, I wept
for you, and mourned in silent anguish when they were refused me! You
know not how stronger than a woman's that heart must be that can resist
the appeal, continued day after day, when it comes from the lips of 'all,
whom we believe to be in the wide world, whom we would bless.' _Words_ may
be met and combated; but the mute lip and imploring eye--_they_ cannot
be resisted; the tenderness that _veils_ its dearest wish for fear of
grieving us; the grief unspoken, and the more bitter from concealment!
Who can see this, _and in a father_, every day, every hour, every minute,
and nerve their hearts to deny the relief they can bestow? But all this
avails nothing; the tie is irrevocable that binds me to misery and severs
us forever. For you, Zanotti, you will go forth into the world; excitement
is an antidote provided for the grief of man. You will win admiration and
applause; your fame as a scholar and a poet, your renown as a soldier,
will secure you a high position among men, higher than your rank alone
would give. You will be loved, you will love again, and _our_ hours of
rapture will linger in your mind but as the recollection of a dream! I
ask but a kindly remembrance and forgiveness of my unintentional sin.
Farewell!"

"And is it thus we part!" There was a proud repelling sorrow in the
lover's tone as he thus replied: "Is this, then, the end of our golden
dream!" He paused, and, suddenly advancing, bent his head close to her
ear, "_Leonora, do you love me still?_" The question was in a whisper. She
started, a singular, a terrified expression mounting into her face. She
was about to speak, but even as the words seemed on the eve of utterance,
a crashing sound, as of some one forcing his way through the thickly
intertwined branches of the neighboring vines, caught the attention of
both herself and her companion, and, with a stifled shriek, she looked
round as if seeking an opposite path by which to escape. Her intention
was frustrated, however, for in an instant after the intruder made his
appearance.

"My husband!"

Leonora said but these two simple words, but there was a desperate
impassibility in the tone in which they were spoken, that told of a heart
whose terror was frozen into despair.

Zanotti, whose face had flushed crimson on the first appearance of the
prince, was again as pale as death. The moon looked calmly down upon all,
and God knows she had seldom shone on three persons whose hearts, in
their agony, came nearer epitomes of hell than the group assembled there.
Leonora seemed rooted to the spot, bound by a spell, a charm. Her small,
beautiful hands were clenched convulsively together; her breath came with
quick and labored gasps; her form seemed convulsed with a terrible and
racking agony! She looked from her lover to her husband--a look beseeching
their mutual forbearance--made a step forward, seemed struggling to
articulate, and fell heavily to the earth.

CHAPTER V.

                  "Ah, 'mid this scene
    Of loveliness and deep serenity,
    The traces of despair, and woe, and death
    Were darkly visible!"

SHE fell at the very feet of her husband, and he looked down with a
smile that was sardonic in its bitterness. Zanotti, under an impulse
that paused not to reflect that under the circumstances the action was
an insult to the man who deemed himself already foully wronged, advanced
with the intention of raising her, but Prince Carlos waved him back. Not a
syllable had either of these men uttered. Their glances were sufficiently
intelligible without speech. They seemed mutually fascinated; a kind
of magnetism seemed to draw upon each the other's eyes. At length, the
terrible silence was broken. It was the prince that spoke, and, as he did
so, his look was terribly significant.

"Come, senor! You wear a sword!"

"What would your highness have?" said Zanotti, in the low, hoarse tone of
a man struggling to subdue irrepressible emotion.

"I have said it. Draw!" was the short reply.

"What, here?" The remark escaped Zanotti unconsciously, as his eye sought
the extended body of the insensible Leonora.

"Ay, sir!" said the prince. "She'll heed it not. In these little plays,
you know, a tragic scene is indispensable to keep up the interest. Why
should not the heroine witness it?"

Zanotti shuddered beneath the maniac look that accompanied this affected
jocularity.

"As you will, sir," said he, sternly, repressing all show of feeling.
"But," he ventured to add, "the lady, prince. It were unnecessary cruelty
to leave her thus."

"Rather say kindness," said the other, solemnly. "It were a mercy if she
never recovered."

The prince drew his sword as he spoke, and motioned to Zanotti to do
the same. He did so, and, even in the momentary period occupied by the
action, what a world of thoughts thronged upon him! He thought of his old
cloister life, when books were at once his mistresses and his friends; he
thought of his first meeting with Leonora d'Alvarez; of their parting,
mitigated by a hope of reunion under happier auspices; of the miserable
disappointment of that hope; and of the fearful future that was before
Leonora, whether he lived or died, unless--and how weak the chance!--her
husband could be convinced of her innocence.

"Prince Carlos," said he, abruptly, as the other placed himself on guard,
"before we enter upon a struggle beside that inanimate body--a struggle in
which death may seal my lips forever--I must crave a moment's attention.
Your wife"--the word seemed almost to choke him--"is innocent of any wrong
at which your suspicions would point."

The prince smiled--a smile of bitter, disdainful incredulity.

"It is true, and it were useless to deny it, I love her."

The prince started as if stung by an adder, the first departure he had
made from his courtly immobility. Zanotti observed the gesture, and it
gave him confidence; it showed this icy statue had human passions. He
added, in a firmer tone than he had been capable of using before--

"Yes, Prince Carlos, the only being my heart worships lies there at your
feet; but that love is of an earlier birth than her knowledge of your
highness, and therefore the acknowledgment cannot be insulting. To-night
I met her for the first time in the space of four years, and the meeting
was accidental. With scarcely the hope of its finding faith, I make this
asseveration. It is necessary for the reputation of that much injured
lady. Her virtue--her purity is as untarnished as yonder sky!"

"Of her _reputation_," said the other, haughtily, "_I_ know how to guard
it. For her VIRTUE". A cold, venomous look of unbelief said the rest.

"Prince," said Zanotti, and his face showed some indignation, mixed with
a haughty assumption of calmness--"prince, my words are probably those of
a man about to solve the mighty secret of futurity, and I swear to you she
is innocent! I pledge you all my hopes of eternal salvation, and trust
that God may spurn me from his throne of mercy if my words contain an
element of falsehood!"

"Oaths, on such an occasion," said the other, coldly, "are worthless.
This is a superfluous waste of words. Leave _her_ defence to herself. The
question is now between you and me. Your presence here, with the avowal of
passion you have made, is in itself an insult demanding reparation. _I_
consent to forget the difference of rank between a hireling soldier and a
prince of Spain, and you can hardly refuse to meet my vengeance."

"Enough, sir!" said Zanotti; "that slight was unnecessary. I am ready."

Their blades crossed, and, at first, every movement was studied and
cautious, as if each sought to measure the other's skill, and hesitated
to risk consequences that, in the situation in which they were placed,
involved life or death. Many a feint passed between them, and each found
in the other a much more formidable antagonist than he had anticipated.
The Italian, the moment his sword touched that of his adversary, regained
at once the calm, resolute bearing of one accustomed to rely upon those
qualities for existence; and the Spaniard, at first, exhibited an equal
degree of coolness. Gradually, however, he grew more excited, and made
one or two lunges, which were quickly parried, but no effort made to
return them. This indicated, on the part of Zanotti, an intention either
to confine his action to defence, or murderously wait an opportunity of
ending the struggle by a single, fatal stroke. Either supposition, as
be-speaking a consciousness of superiority, was sufficiently galling to
add to his excitement, and his thrusts increased in number, leaving him at
each more and more exposed. But, suddenly, Zanotti altered his tactics.
He brought his "_forte_" in contact with his opponent's "_foible_," and
the next instant the prince's weapon, twirled from his grasp, was spinning
through the air and fell upon the ground at some distance from where they
stood.

For one moment, one single moment, the Spaniard glared upon him, his face
bearing a look of concentrated venomous hate, then, snatching from its
jewelled sheath a short stiletto, he sprang with the bound of an enraged
panther upon his foe. Taken unprepared--for, the moment his adversary was
disarmed, he had dropped the point of his own weapon--Zanotti staggered
and fell, and the next instant the dagger was, as it seemed, plunged up to
the very hilt in his heart.

Drawing the weapon from its still palpitating sheath, he wiped the blade,
and then, with hands wet with her lover's blood, took the form of Leonora,
yet happily insensible, and bore it to the palazzo. There was still
revelry and mirth within.

       *       *       *       *       *

Years have passed; it is night, and the stars are scattered over the
broad, clear face of heaven, an archipelago of worlds. There has been a
thunder storm during the afternoon, and large rain-drops still burden the
foliage and the grass, sparkling like a maiden's bridal tears. The sky
hangs, as it were, in quiet fondness over the earth, and the night-wind is
sighing love tales to the flowers.

In a garden, situated a few miles from Cordova, which incloses within its
high walls a lightly, but tastefully built edifice of considerable size,
are assembled some six or eight persons of both sexes. Their attitudes
and occupations are various. One young girl reclines negligently, but
gracefully, on the still damp grass, and touches the chords of a guitar
with no unskilful hand; a fine-looking man, in the prime of life, paces
up and down a long avenue, and seems to be absorbed in meditation;
and another, a lady, is weaving flowers into garlands. She is a
splendid-looking woman, of perhaps five-and-thirty years of age, with
those large, liquid black eyes that seem to absorb and reflect back to you
a portion of your own soul. Her look, however, is sad and hopeless, even
her smile giving but a pale, wintry gleam. Ever and anon she sighs, too,
and talks to herself in a tone unintelligible to the ear, but breathing a
sad, Æolian strain to the heart. Her eye wanders in bewilderment, seeking
imagined forms. Her emotions seem to be all mute, expressionless, without
a language, and translatable only by signs. _It is Leonora; she is crazed!_

       *       *       *       *       *


CHAPTER VI.

    "And thus, untaught in youth my heart to tame,
      My springs of life were poisoned--'tis too late:
    Yet am I changed; though still enough the same
      In strength to bear what time cannot abate,
      And feed on bitter fruits without accusing fate."
                                               BYRON.

AGAIN 'twas night; but this time deepening into morn. In a spacious
chamber, furnished with all the appliances of opulent luxury, sat a man,
upon whose massive brow forty winters had traced many a deep and rugged
line. He seemed one who had not been slighted by fortune, for the insignia
of several illustrious orders hung upon his breast. A small cabinet table,
upon which were strewed gorgeously bound books and written papers of
various kinds, was drawn up beside him. The materials for writing were
also there; but he heeded them not, but sat with his head leaning upon his
hands apparently in abstracted meditation.

He remained in this position for full an hour, not moving a single muscle,
and more like a dead than a living thing. Then he arose suddenly, and
paced the apartment with a vigorous and hasty step. His limbs were firm
and his form athletic; it was his _head_ only that looked old. This
also lasted some time, and then he sat down once more, and, unlocking a
concealed drawer, drew forth a letter and a miniature. Upon the letter
he gazed long and earnestly, his look assuming an expression of mingled
terror and dejection piteous to behold. Laying down the picture with
a sigh, he then opened the billet and began to read, his countenance
becoming each moment more careworn and haggard. And it was not strange it
should be so; for it is a mournful thing to look upon the letters that
once told of the throbbing affection of some friend or loved one, when
the friendship is dead or merged in a deeper feeling for another, or the
love is banished forever from its chosen temple. To recall the words that
dropped on the page; archangels proclaiming with trumpet notes that we
were the idol of one beating heart at least; to bring up again our old
smile, and find it gleams, and with no Promethean power, upon affection's
corse. Ah me, 'tis sad, indeed! The reader muttered to himself ever and
anon, but his words were disjointed and unintelligible. He sighed, too,
frequently and deeply, and even groaned aloud as he read the following
passage:--

"Oh, believe me, your highness, it is fate, and not my own will, that
makes me seem ungrateful! The gratitude your priceless favor has
engendered in my breast is so warm, so fervid, that _my life_ would be
cheerfully given in requital; but when you ask _my heart_, alas! I can
only say, I have it not to give. Years ago, ere I had seen your highness,
or dreamed of the possibility of our ever meeting, Love had in my heart
a Minerva birth, and, though the object of it lies in a bloody grave in
a stranger's land, it will live in my own weary soul while it remains
on earth, and accompany it when it flees to join him. You say, 'Perhaps
I have not yet been fortunate enough to win your love or attract your
regard but let me beseech you at least to receive and weigh the depth,
the purity, the strength of my devotion against that of other men ere you
decide.' Monseignor, you _compel_, even were _I not willing to accord_, my
'esteem;' my worthless 'regard,' and all the love my father and the dead
do not claim, you also have; but were I to consent to your request, and
become your wife, at his own altar should I send up a perjured vow to God."

Carefully, he placed both letter and picture in the drawer from whence he
had taken them; but, instead of locking it, drew forth another "billet."
It was much shorter, a mere note, in fact, but seemed to contain matter as
pregnant with agitation as its predecessor. He paused some time over the
following postscript:--

"You tell me that the grave, in closing over the object of my love,
severed the tie between him and me forever--that death pronounced a
divorce which gave me liberty to form another attachment. You know not
woman's love to say so. It is impossible, when once ignited, to quench it
entirely. It may be unseen, the ashes may be cold; but a spark certainly
slumbers beneath them, and will never, never die! Oh, your highness, let
me entreat you to select some worthier object than myself upon which to
lavish your affections! I can never be yours!"

The man read this to the end. When he had finished, there was a smile
of mockery upon his face; but a spasmodic shudder which convulsed his
frame evinced the pain which it was meant to hide. How we learn to cheat
_ourselves_ by playing the hypocrite to others! The letter fell from his
grasp to the floor. His head assumed its old position on his hand, and he
gazed on vacancy. He remained in this posture so long that the candles
one by one flickered and went out, not even perceiving, so great was his
abstraction, the glare they gave just before they expired. The large
gothic window immediately opposite to where he sat was open, and the air
grew cooler and cooler each moment. It seemed, however, as if there were
no stars in the sky--all was darkness. Suddenly, a terrific flash of
lightning illumined earth and heaven, and cast a strong ruddy glare upon
every object in the apartment. A tremendous peal of thunder followed, and
the man started to his feet and advanced to the window. The rain was now
coming down in large drops, and flash after flash of lightning, and peal
after peal of thunder followed each other with astounding rapidity. The
wind, which had lain motionless and dead previous to the beginning of the
storm, now at one moment went rushing by with extreme violence, and the
next sank into a low moan that was awful enough to blanch the cheek and
palsy the heart of the stoutest. It was like the wailing voice of a God
sorrowing over the sins of man, or the spirit of earth singing a dirge
over vanished time.

The tenant of the chamber stood with folded arms, regardless of the fierce
gusts that ever and anon dashed the heavy rain-drops in his face, and
the ghastly blue tint cast upon his countenance by the lightning made
him look unearthly enough to be the arbiter of the dreadful contest then
raging between the shrieking storm fiends. His eye grew brighter and more
glistening. There seemed a sympathy between the unchained elements in
their rage and his own proud spirit. His form dilated, and he seemed to
look with a strange delight upon the swaying trees bending beneath the
terrific blasts of wind, and to list to the crashing thunder with a fierce
joy. A magnificent oak, which had resisted every attempt of the tempest to
more than shake its smaller limbs, was suddenly torn up by the very roots,
and, with a rushing noise, fell to the ground. The very earth seemed to
groan as it fell.

"Thus would _I_ die," exclaimed the looker on, exultingly--"thus would
I die! Amid a world's agonizing throes, when the mountains seem to bend
their scathed tops, and the ocean roars its submission to the storm."

As he spoke, he advanced, heedless of the elements, through the casement,
and stood upon the extreme edge of the battlemented parapet. A shrill,
mocking laugh greeted his concluding words, and a voice, that seemed to
his excited imagination preternaturally hollow, exclaimed--

"And die thus you shall!"

For a moment he stood perfectly paralyzed; but a heavy hand was laid upon
his shoulder, and he turned to meet the glare of two eyes that shone as if
lit with fire from hell. The person from whom the glance proceeded held in
a threatening position a long, keen-looking dagger, and the blade gleamed
brightly in the electric light with which a sudden flash of lightning
illumined the scene. The man who had a moment before looked defiantly upon
the wrathy heavens shrank from the danger which now threatened him from
a human foe. It was, however, but for a moment. He saw in the implacable
countenance of the man who had so strangely come upon him, sufficient
evidence of some dark and evil purpose to make him look for mischief. He
suspected the existence of a danger that would tax his every energy. He
turned upon the intruder a look of inquiry, firm and proud, and somewhat
rebuking in its aspect. The next moment, however, recollecting that,
in the intervals between the flashes, all was invisible, he put the
question audibly, which before he had mutely expressed. A tremendous peal
of thunder drowned the words in its frightful reverberations, and the
lightning that followed showed him the arm of his foe raised to strike.
Even as the blade touched his breast he caught his adversary's wrist and
threw himself upon him. Powerful he found him beyond all expectations, and
his cheek turned ghastly pale, for he felt hope deserting him.

The struggle was terrible; a look of vengeful despair sat on the beaded
brow of one, and deep, dark, unmitigable hate gleamed in the strained
eyeballs of the other. The assailed man chafed like a maimed lion in the
hunter's toils, and his efforts bore that character of ruthless savageness
which is the consequence of hopeless fear--of rayless despair. The other,
in the proud consciousness of tried strength, dashed his dagger into
the bosom of the clouded chaos that formed the atmosphere in which they
fought, and, by the exertion of resistless bodily power, bore his victim
back towards the verge of the parapet. _Too_ pale to seem human, like the
animated statues of two contending gladiators, they rocked to and fro on
its extremity. A momentary strife ensued, in which the muscles of each
seemed cracking with the might of their exertions. For a single instant,
the assailant seemed to give way, and the heart of his victim beat with
a hope that intensity made an agony; but the relaxation was but the
prelude to a more violent effort. Again they were upon the verge of the
battlement--they balanced upon the edge--and then sank into the darkness.
A wild, sardonic laugh, and a cry of agony that seemed to freeze the very
elements and hush their destructive howl into silence, went up to heaven,
succeeded by a dull, heavy sound that announced the departure of two souls
to judgment.

The next day the patrol discovered, beneath the postern that opened upon
the castle fosse, two mangled bodies, quite dead. The one was the Prince
Carlos, Regent of Spain, and the other the Count Carlo Zanotti.

THE ORPHAN'S DEPARTURE.

BY MARGARET FLOYD.

(_See Plate._)


THE early years of few have been so carefully guarded and protected as
were those of Edith Frazier. Her father was the rector of a church in
a beautiful but secluded country village in the south of England. In
addition to his sincere piety and high-toned moral character, Mr. Frazier
possessed a well-cultivated mind. His wife was also a superior woman, and
as Edith was their only child, her early training was the object of their
most careful attention. In a lovely and sequestered home, surrounded not
only by the comforts and luxuries, but the elegances of life, and in close
association with persons of high refinement and elevated goodness, the
young girl grew slowly up to womanhood. There was no undue excitement of
vanity or the passions to force her, like some hothouse plant, into an
early maturity; and no unseasonable call upon her for self-reliance or
exertion, which entirely blots out of some lives the sweet carelessness of
girlhood. At sixteen, she was still almost a child, when the death of her
mother, her first great sorrow, made her sensible for the first time that
this world is not the place for that uninterrupted happiness which had,
until then, been her portion.

Edith was almost heart-broken at the loss of her mother. They had been
constant companions, and she missed her every moment more and more. Mr.
Frazier tried to supply to his daughter the place both of father and
mother, but he was a studious, reserved man, and himself suffering deeply
from his bereavement, so that they did little else but remind each other
constantly of their great sorrow.

About a year after Mrs. Frazier's death, finding that his daughter did not
rally from the depression so foreign to her nature, Mr. Frazier proposed a
tour through the northern part of England and Scotland. It was just at the
beginning of the pleasant summer weather, and, arranging matters in his
parish so that his absence for two or three months would not be felt, he
decided to leave immediately.

On the Sunday before his departure, a stranger was seen in the little
parish church. He was a man who would have been noticed in any place, and
who, in a quiet country village, was an object of general attention.
Tall, handsome, and with a strikingly high-bred and gentlemanlike
appearance, he would have been singled out anywhere as one of nature's
nobility. Edith was struck and gratified by the stranger's evident
interest in the sermon her father preached that day. It was one with which
he had taken especial pains, and the daughter, proud as well as fond of
her father, was glad to see that he had at least one appreciative listener.

A few days after, Mr. Frazier and Edith set out on their journey.
London was their first stopping-place, and several very busy days were
spent there, while Edith, with the vivid interest of one to whom almost
everything in that vast and crowded city was strange and new, visited the
many places of interest and note within it. While they were standing in
St. Paul's, the stranger who had attracted their attention in Hillcomb,
their own village, a few days before, passed them with a look of evident
recognition. They met again while going over Westminster Abbey; and it
so happened that they were at the same time paying to the genius of
Shakspeare the homage of a visit to his grave at Stratford, and that they
passed each other again while strolling over the grounds around Newstead
Abbey.

By this time they had advanced so far on the way to acquaintanceship,
that, when they again encountered each other near the lakes in
Westmoreland, the home of so many of the poets of England, a bow was the
almost involuntary mark of recognition. English reserve and shyness might
have prevented any more intimate intercourse, but for an accident that
happened to Edith in Scotland.

Mr. Frazier, finding that the cool and bracing air of that country had
as favorable an effect on his daughter's health as the wild and romantic
scenery had on her mind, and being pleased with a quiet country inn which
he had found, proposed that they should make it their home for two or
three weeks. They could not have found a pleasanter resting-place, for
Lock Lomond was spread out in its calm serenity at their feet, and Ben
Lomond towered in savage grandeur above their heads.

The first person whom they recognized on taking their seats at the table
of the inn was the stranger whom they had met so frequently. Edith could
not repress a smile as she shyly returned the stranger's salutation, at
the chance that seemed to take such a whimsical pleasure in thus bringing
them together. A few days after, while walking with her father in the rude
paths on the side of the mountain, she strayed a little way from him when
he stopped to admire the scene from some particularly favorable point of
view; and when she attempted to return, she found herself, to her dismay,
so perplexed by the intricate windings of the paths that she was at a loss
which to take. She called to her father and heard his voice in reply,
but it grew fainter and fainter, until, at last, it could no longer be
discerned. Becoming aware that every step she took only led her farther
from home, she stopped to see if she could not in some way distinguish
the right path. But she was so utterly bewildered that she found it to
be impossible. She thought that the only thing that was left for her to
do was to remain stationary; in that way she would, at least, avoid the
danger of falling into the mountain streams around, or down any of the
precipices.

Night closed around Edith as she sat alone under the shelter of a gray
rock that jutted out from the side of the mountain. She had around her
only the light shawl she had thrown on for an afternoon's walk, and it was
but a slight protection from the chilling night-air. In her hurried and
toilsome search after her father, she had bruised her feet and wearied
herself so that she could no longer stand. She called at intervals, in the
faint hope that some wanderer might hear her and come to her assistance;
but her voice died away from exhaustion, and she was still alone.

It was not so much a feeling of fear that weighed upon her, for the
perfect trust in her all-seeing Father, which her mother had taught her
from her childhood, was a tower of strength to her in this her hour of
need; and the physical discomfort she could bear; but the thought of her
father's anxiety and distress on her account almost overcame her.

The stars were going out one by one, when Edith heard in the distance a
faint shout. She could not answer it, but, almost as if led by some unseen
spirit, it came nearer and nearer. At last she gathered voice to reply,
and she had evidently been heard. She could distinguish the sound of
footsteps, and at last dimly discern a man's figure as it stopped before
her.

"Is this Miss Frazier?" said the man in a voice that revealed its owner
to be a person of refinement and tenderness.

"Yes," said Edith, rising with difficulty.

"I am Mr. Hildreth, the gentleman whom you have met so frequently lately.
I heard of your disappearance from your father, and have been seeking for
some hours. Could you walk a little way with me? He is not far from here;
we can soon find him."

Edith tried to walk, but found it impossible. Taking her in his arms, Mr.
Hildreth carried her a little way; then meeting her father, he resigned
her to him while he went before to act as a guide. With some difficulty
they reached the bottom of the mountain, and obtaining a rude vehicle from
some of the country people near, conveyed Edith to the inn.

The acquaintance thus begun soon ripened into a friendship. Mr. Frazier
and Edith learned that Mr. Hildreth was an American from the city of New
York. The letters of introduction that he had with him proved that he had
a right to the best society in England, for which his polished manners
and uncommon conversational powers showed that he was well fitted. He had
been taking an invalid aunt to the south of France for the benefit of the
climate, he told them, and after seeing her comfortably established there,
he had taken advantage of a few months' leisure to travel wherever his
fancy led him. He readily accepted Mr. Frazier's invitation to join him
and his daughter in their tour. The similarity of taste they had shown so
singularly was a sufficient evidence, he said, that any course they might
take would be equally agreeable to both parties.

The next six weeks, Edith thought, were the most delightful she had ever
spent. Nowhere does the society of an agreeable and intellectual person
add more to the enjoyment of the company than in travelling. Although
grave and quiet, Mr. Hildreth was full of thoughtfulness and observant
care for the comfort of his fellow-travellers. Whenever he spoke to Edith,
there was a gentle deference in his manner that, from one of his superior
abilities, was irresistibly attractive.

On his side, Mr. Hildreth was no less charmed by those with whom he had
been so strangely thrown. On the Sunday in which he had first seen them,
he had been pleased and impressed by Mr. Frazier's sermon, and thought
that he had never seen a face of more artless and attractive loveliness
than Edith Frazier's. She reminded him of Chaucer's beauties, of a rose
half opened and still wet with the morning dews, and of all that was most
fresh and delicate in nature. Her mind answered to the promise of her
countenance. Ignorant of the world and uncontaminated by it, she walked
in almost unconscious innocence the simple path of duty. Her disposition,
naturally cheerful and bright, had already begun to recover its buoyancy,
and her happiness reacted on her graver companions, who seemed to vie with
each other as to which should add most to her pleasure.

Seasons of unshaded happiness are generally as brief as bright. By the
end of the six weeks, Mr. Hildreth received a letter from his aunt, who
wrote urgently for his immediate presence. He took a reluctant leave of
his companions, but not before he had had a long conversation with Mr.
Frazier, in which he asked his permission to reveal to Edith the love that
had already become a strong feeling in his heart.

Heretofore he had been thrown, he said, among a set of worldly and
fashionable women, and had come to look upon simplicity and unworldliness
as traits no longer to be met with among the educated and polished members
of society, and Edith Frazier exhibited a character as new as attractive
to him. She was the only woman that he had ever met, whose society and
conversation never wearied or lost their interest to him.

Mr. Frazier's paternal pride was gratified at the tribute thus paid to
Edith by a man like Mr. Hildreth, but he could not bear to think of giving
up the only object of affection left to him, nor contemplate without pain
the idea that his daughter's home might be in a distant land. He did
all that he felt justified in doing to avert the day of separation, and
pleading Edith's youth, requested Mr. Hildreth to postpone for a year his
declaration. To this delay Mr. Hildreth was unwilling to consent; but at
last was obliged unwillingly to yield to a probation of six months.

He left Edith, in accordance with the promise he had made Mr. Frazier,
entirely unconscious of his feelings towards her, and for some time
almost equally unaware of her own. She knew that the loss of his society
had deprived her of the greater part of the pleasure she had taken in
the new scenes through which she was journeying, but it was not until
she was again settled in her own home at Hillcomb that she began to feel
that Mr. Hildreth had been far more to her than a mere agreeable casual
acquaintance.

This discovery mortified her extremely. She felt as though it was both
wrong and humiliating, that one whom she had known so short a time, and
who had shown no proof of regarding her as anything but a very young
and rather pleasing girl, should engross so much of her thoughts. She
resolved to use every means to crush the feelings that, new as they were,
seemed to have struck their roots so deeply in her heart. But first she
could not resist asking her father one question.

"Do you think we shall ever see Mr. Hildreth again, father?" said she one
day, with affected indifference.

"Perhaps so," said he, quietly; "we can never tell what may happen."

"He can never have spoken to my father about coming here," thought Edith,
"or he would not have seemed so uncertain about it;" and, with true
feminine pride, the young girl forbore any farther mention of the one whom
yet she found it impossible to forget.

Two months of the six had passed away, when Edith was called to bear
another heavy trial. Her father died suddenly, leaving her unprovided
for and alone in the world. Such an event was apparently the last in the
world to be expected, as Mr. Frazier had always seemed to be a man in
vigorous health, and with a fair prospect of long life. To a long life
he had evidently looked forward, for he had made no arrangements for his
cherished daughter, and had left no directions by which she might guide
her future course.

In her desolation, Edith could think of but one person from whom she might
expect protection; a half-sister of her father's, who resided in London.
She had seen her aunt, Mrs. Burnleigh, but seldom, but knew that she was a
widow in easy circumstances, with a large family of children. To her she
accordingly applied, and received in return an invitation to come to her
until she had decided on her future course.

With a sorrowful heart, Edith left the home where so many bright and happy
years had been passed. As she sat alone waiting for the coach to pass
that was to convey her to London, with no attendant but the gardener's
boy, and no companion but her canary, a parting gift from Mr. Hildreth,
sent to Hillcomb by him from Dover just before he embarked for France,
the contrast between her present desolation and the warm, sheltering
love in which she had so long lived, almost overcame her. But the lonely
soon acquire the power of self-control, and Edith had already begun to
learn the hard lesson of self-reliance. With an outward composure that
hid the painful throbbings of her heart from her travelling companions,
she took her seat in the coach, and in a few hours arrived safely at Mrs.
Burnleigh's.

Edith found her aunt an apparently well-meaning, proper kind of a woman,
kind and sympathizing in her manners, but who evidently had not the
slightest intention of denying herself or her children the smallest luxury
for the sake of her brother's orphaned daughter. For a few weeks Edith
was left to the quiet indulgence of her grief, and then Mrs. Burnleigh,
thinking that she had done all that society could possibly demand of her
in the way of respect to her brother's memory or kindness to his child,
began to sound Edith as to her intentions for the future.

The young girl, thrown so suddenly upon her own resources, had not yet
begun to think for herself, and the idea of seeking a home among strangers
made her heart sink within her. She begged her aunt to take upon herself
the task of finding for her some position that she could fill creditably,
but she hoped, she said, timidly, that it might be somewhere near her
aunt, her only remaining relative.

This did not suit Mrs. Burnleigh exactly, who, being of that turn of mind
that always foresees the possible evil in all cases, was not pleased
with the idea that she might at any time be called upon to offer a home
to her friendless relative. Like a prudent woman, however, she forbore
saying anything that might reveal her true feelings, but was none the less
resolved that, if two equally favorable situations offered themselves, it
would be wiser for her to advise Edith to accept the one at the greatest
distance.

She succeeded beyond her hopes. Coming in one day, she said to Edith, with
unusual animation--

"My dear, I have found a most delightful situation for you. Two hundred
pounds a year for teaching one little girl. You can speak French, can you
not?"

"Yes, I have spent a year in France."

"And you play unusually well, and draw and paint beautifully, so that I
think the parents of the child may consider themselves quite fortunate."

"Who are they?" asked Edith

"They are Americans--a Mr. and Mrs. Blake, from South Carolina."

Edith's heart had bounded at the mention of the country, but it sank when
the state was named to which Mrs. Burnleigh wished to send her. Unlike
most English girls, she knew enough of the geography of the United States
to remember that a wide distance separated South Carolina from New York,
so that, even if Mr. Hildreth had returned to his own country, which
was unlikely, she would be almost as distant from him there as if she
remained in England. The idea of going so far away from all on whom her
relationship or early association gave her any claim, was exceedingly
painful to her.

"Don't you think, dear aunt," said she, hesitatingly, "that I might find
something to do nearer home?"

"It would be impossible for me to find you another situation so
advantageous in every respect; but, if you think you could succeed, you
had better make the attempt," replied Mrs. Burnleigh, coldly, while a
displeased expression settled upon her face.

There were a few moments' silence, and then Edith said--

"How soon will Mr. and Mrs. Blake expect me?"

"They are now here. I have just met them at one of my friends, who had
been speaking to them about you. They told me that they intended to sail
for America in about two weeks, and that, if you were ready by that time,
they would like you to accompany them."

"Very well," said Edith; "you can tell them that I shall be ready to go
with them."

"They are charming people," said her aunt, caressingly; "I am sure, my
dear, you will like them very much, and be very happy with them. Of
course, I would not wish my brother's child to go where she would not be
with those who are likely to take some interest in her."

Edith could not help perceiving that her aunt was relieved by the prospect
of her departure; and this thought, while it strengthened her in her
resolve, made her feel her isolation still more deeply.

On board the same steamer with Mr. and Mrs. Blake and Edith was a little
girl, an invalid, who interested the young English girl extremely. Edith
had brought her bird with her. It was the only thing she had to remind her
of happier days, and she could not bear to part with it. At little Ellen's
earnest request, she hung the cage in her state-room, and, before the end
of the voyage, the little sick girl had become so attached to the pretty
bird, whose sweet song was almost the only cheering sound she heard during
the long and weary days at sea, that she could not speak of parting with
it without showing by her tearful eyes the pain it gave her. Edith felt
that she ought not to deprive the little sufferer of so great a pleasure,
and, concealing her reluctance to give up a souvenir she had cherished
so long, she told little Ellen that the bird was to be hers. The child's
evident delight was some compensation to Edith for her self-denial, yet
it was with a sharp pang that she watched the cage as it was put in the
carriage, after the arrival of the steamer at New York, to be conveyed
to the upper part of the city, while Edith, with her new friends, went on
board another steamer about to sail for Charleston.

Mr. Blake's residence was among the pine forests of the State; a region
healthful, it is true, but peculiarly desolate, especially to one
accustomed to the soft verdure and smiling landscape of England. The tall
dark trees; unceasingly sighing forth their low and mournful murmurs,
seemed to Edith a fit emblem of the griefs that were henceforward to
darken her life.

There was but little in her new home to call her thoughts from the sad
recollections to which they were constantly recurring. Mr. Blake and
his wife were very kind to her, treating her rather as a guest than one
to whose services they were entitled; but they lived in a part of the
country very thinly settled, their nearest neighbor being at a distance
of seven or eight miles, and there was a wearying monotony in Edith's
daily life that weighed upon her spirits. Gratitude for the unvarying
and thoughtful kindness shown to her by Mrs. Blake induced Edith to make
every exertion to regain her accustomed cheerfulness, and she had, in
some measure, succeeded, when the Christmas holidays came to remind her,
by the contrast between her own position and that of the persons by whom
she was surrounded, more painfully of her isolation. The little family
gatherings, from which she could hardly absent herself without appearing
unmindful of Mrs. Blake's gentle yet urgent requests, and yet where she
felt herself among them, but not of them, recalled to her so forcibly the
former seasons, when her happiness and pleasure were to all around her
the one thing of the greatest importance, that, for the first time since
her departure from England, Edith yielded to her feelings of loneliness,
and every night wet her pillow with her tears. The reply of the Shunamite
woman to the prophet's inquiry about her wants, "I dwell among mine own
people," came with a new and touching significance to her mind, now that
she began to feel that never again would she feel the sweet security and
protection implied in such a position.

On New Year's eve, Edith slipped away from the merry group assembled in
Mr. Blake's parlors to indulge her sad meditations for a little while
without interruption. As she stood on the porch listening to the mournful
music of the pines, whose aromatic incense filled the air with its
healthful fragrance, and watching the moon as it slowly waded through the
clouded sky, now shining out in full brilliancy, and then almost entirely
darkened as it passed behind the thick masses of vapor that were hanging
in the vast concave, she thought that just such sudden alternations of
darkness and light had been her lot in this life.

"The clouds hang heavily over me now," thought she; "but there will be
brightness soon."

Almost at the same moment there came the sound of an approaching arrival,
and Edith hastily retreated to the house. She had hardly time to mingle
with the gay family party, when, hearing her name called, she turned
suddenly, while a thrill of amazed delight passed over her at the familiar
tone, and saw before her Mr. Hildreth, whose smile shed a light and warmth
upon her heart to which it had long been a stranger.

The clouds were at once lifted off from her soul, and she was once more
the light-hearted girl she had been in her English home. In the midst
of her happiness there was a feeling of insecurity, a doubt as to its
continuance. But that Edith would not allow herself to dwell upon. It was
happiness enough for the present to think that one whom she so highly
esteemed still cared enough for her to seek her out in her secluded home.

But before the last hours of the old year had passed away, walking in
the serene moonlight under those pine-trees to whose mournful murmur her
thoughts had been so long attuned, Edith listened with a beating heart to
the avowal of the same feelings which Mr. Hildreth had confessed to her
father more than a year before. What had become of all the sadness that
had brooded over Edith's heart so many months? It was gone like the clouds
from the sky, but not to return, like them, in a few short hours.

"How did you find me out?" asked Edith, after many more important
questions had been asked and answered.

"Ah, a little bird told me where I should find the runaway."

"A bird?" said Edith, wonderingly.

"Perhaps it was the cage rather than the bird," replied Mr. Hildreth.
"I had been for some two or three months in search of you, or rather
your aunt, with whom I was told you were staying. But she seemed to be
possessed by some perverse and wandering spirit; for, when I went to
London to find her, she had just left with her family on a tour through
Germany, and, when I followed her there, I learned she had gone into
Italy. Into Italy I went post haste, and reached Naples just in time to
learn that Mrs. Burnleigh had left the week before for Egypt and the
Pyramids. No whit daunted, I was about to seek you, even if I had to go
to the heart of Ethiopia, when the sudden illness of my aunt recalled me
to Marseilles. Her death obliged me to return to New York; but I arranged
my business there as soon as possible, and had already engaged my passage
in the next steamer to Liverpool, when, walking through Fifth Avenue,
my eye was attracted by a cage that I recognized instantly, by certain
peculiarities, as one that I had sent you just before I left England after
our pleasant tour. A sudden hope seized me that some happy impulse had
led your travel-loving aunt to my very hearthstone, and I lost no time in
making inquiries of the lady of the house, from whom I learned all about
the little Edith for whom I had been seeking in such far away places.

"And now, dearest," he continued, after a pause, "have you any objection
to a tour through Europe? I went in such haste before that, far from
satisfying my curiosity, I only increased the desire to see everything
more at my leisure."

"None at all," said Edith, with a smile and blush.

"Well, then, I will see how soon Mrs. Blake can spare you, and we will set
off on our travels. I hope she will be very obliging about it."

She was very obliging, and gave Edith, to whom she had become strongly
attached, a grand wedding in the southern fashion, which lasted two days,
and she hung the pine grove with colored lamps, so that the dark woods
took, for that occasion only, quite a festal appearance.

CELESTIAL PHENOMENA.--APRIL.

BY D. W. BELISLE.


LEO.--This is one of the most clearly defined and brilliant constellations
in the winter hemisphere, containing an unusual number of very bright
stars. It is situated east of Cancer, and comes to the meridian the sixth
of this month. This constellation contains ninety-five stars visible to
the naked eye.

    "Two splendid stars of highest dignity,
    Two of the second class the Lion boasts,
    And justly figures the fierce summer's rage."

Five very bright stars in this constellation are grouped in the form of
a sickle. Regulus, in the shoulder of Leo, is the lowest of this group,
and forms the end of the handle in the sickle. It is the brightest star
in the cluster, and is of great use to nautical men in determining their
longitude at sea. Eta, a small glittering star, marks the other end of
the handle, while Al Gieba Adhafera, Ras al Asad, and Lambda form the
blade. Two small stars, at an equal distance from Lambda, form a small
right-angled triangle. Denebola, in the brush of the tail, is a star of
the first magnitude, and, with Zozma in the back, and Theta in the thigh,
form a triangle whose vertex is Denebola.

According to Greek mythology, the Lion was one of the formidable animals
killed by Hercules in the forests of Nemæa, and was placed by Jupiter in
the heavens to commemorate the event. Egyptian mythologists claim the
honor of having placed it there, asserting it was placed in the heavens
to commemorate the haunting of the banks of the Nile during the heat of
summer by these monsters, the river then being at its highest elevation.

       *       *       *       *       *

LEO MINOR.--This constellation is of modern origin, occupying the space
between Ursa Major and Leo Major. The stars in the cluster are of the
third and fourth magnitude, with no particular interest attached to them.
It comes to the meridian the 6th of April.

       *       *       *       *       *

SEXTANT.--This is a small constellation south of Leo, and contains
forty-one stars, all very small and unimportant, and comes to the meridian
the 6th of April. This constellation is sometimes called Urania's Sextant,
in honor of one of the muses who presided over Astronomy. Urania was
daughter of Jupiter and Mnemosyne.

       *       *       *       *       *

HYDRA.--This is an extraordinary constellation, winding through a vast
space from east to west for more than one hundred degrees. It lies
south of Cancer, Leo, and Virgo, and reaches from Canis Minor to Libra.
It contains sixty stars, principally of the second, third, and fourth
magnitudes. The head of Hydra may readily be distinguished by four bright
stars south of Acubens, in the Crab. They form a rhomboidal figure.
The three upper stars form a beautiful curve, and are too distinct and
conspicuous to be forgotten when once seen. Alphard, twenty-three degrees
south south-west of Regulus, is a very brilliant star of the second
magnitude, and is in the heart of Hydra, and comes to the meridian twenty
minutes before nine o'clock on the 1st of April. When the head of the
Hydra is on the meridian, its other extremity is many degrees below the
horizon, so that its whole length cannot be traced out in the heavens
until its centre is on the meridian.

              "Near the Equator rolls
    The sparkling Hydra, proudly eminent,
    To drink the Galaxy's refulgent sea;
    Nearly a fourth of the encircling curve
    Which girds the ecliptic his vast folds involve;
    Yet ten the number of his stars diffused
    O'er the long track of his enormous spires;
    Chief beams his heart, sure of the second rank,
    But emulous to gain the first."

According to mythology, the Hydra was a terrible monster that infested the
Lake of Lerna, in the Peloponnesus. It was reported to have had a hundred
heads, and, as soon as one of these was cut off, two grew in its place,
unless the wound was stopped by fire.

    "Art thou proportioned to the Hydra's length,
    Who, by his wounds, received augmented strength?
    He raised a hundred hissing heads in air;
    When one I lopped, up sprang a dreadful pair."

The formidable monster was at last destroyed by Hercules, with the
assistance of Iolaus, and who afterwards, dipping his arrows in the gall
of the Hydra, rendered every wound inflicted by them incurable and mortal.

       *       *       *       *       *

THE CUP.--This small constellation lies south of the Lion, and rests upon
the Hydra. Six of the principal stars form a crescent or semi-circle,
opening to the west. The crescent of the Cup is so striking and clearly
defined, when the moon is absent, that no description is necessary to
point it out, as it is the only one of the kind in that part of the
heavens.

       *       *       *       *       *

COMETS.--These objects of extraordinary interest form a part in the
economy of the solar system. Since the time when the presence of a comet
was considered by nations to be the sure precursor of war, famine, and
pestilence, up to the present period, these visitors have created much
speculation and excitement; and, no longer ago than the fall of 1853, it
was predicted by an eminent "professor" that one of these waifs in the
heavens would come in collision with the earth, and destroy a portion of
China. This, however, like many other pieces of mischief which had been
predicted it would accomplish, failed, and the professor has retired from
observation covered with the laurels won by his research.

A comet, so brilliant that it could be seen at noonday, made its
appearance seventy-three years before the birth of our Saviour. This date
was just after the death of Julius Cæsar, and by the Romans the comet was
believed to be his metamorphosed soul, armed with fire and vengeance. This
comet appeared again in 1106, and then resembled the sun in brightness,
being of great size, and having an immense trail.

In 1456, a large comet made its appearance. The terror it created extended
through all classes, and the belief was universal that the day of judgment
was at hand. At this time, the Turks, with their victorious armies, seemed
destined to overrun all Europe. This added to the gloom and terror. The
people became regardless of the present, and anxious only for the future.
To prepare the world for its expected doom, Pope Callixtus III. ordered
the Ave Maria to be repeated three times instead of twice a day, and to it
was added, "Lord, save us from the Devil, the Turk, and the Comet!" and
thrice each day these obnoxious personages suffered excommunication. At
length, the comet began to retire from eyes in which it found no favor,
and the Turks retired to their own dominions.

The comet of 1680 was of the largest size, having a trail ninety-six
millions of miles in length. Dawning science, however, robbed it of its
terrors, assisted by the signal failure of its illustrious predecessor.

Such are many of the fantasies which these peculiar visitors have called
up. The beautiful comet of 1811, the most splendid of modern times, was
considered, even by many intelligent persons, as the harbinger of the
war which was declared the spring following; and the remembrance will be
fresh in the minds of many of an indefinite apprehension of some dreadful
catastrophe, which pervaded both continents, in anticipation of Bela's
comet in 1832.

Comets, unlike the planets, observe no one direction in their orbits, but
approach to and recede from their great centre of attraction in every
possible direction. Some seem to come up from immeasurable depths below
the ecliptic, and, having doubled the heaven's mighty cape, again plunged
downward with their fiery trains,

    "On the long travel of a thousand years."

Again, they seem to come from the zenith of the universe, and, after
doubling their perihelion about the sun, reascend far above human vision.
Others, again, seem to be dashing through the solar system in every
conceivable direction, apparently in an undisturbed path; others are
known, however, to obey laws like those which regulate planets. Nothing
is known with certainty as to the composition of these bodies, although
it is certain they contain very little matter, for they produce little or
no effect on the motions of planets when passing near those bodies. Upon
what errands they come, what regions they visit when they pass from view,
what is the difference between them, the sun, and planets, and what is
their mission in the economy of the universe, are questions often pondered
over, but the solution of which is beyond the limited powers of human
understanding.

MRS. MURDEN'S TWO DOLLAR SILK.

BY THE AUTHOR OF "MISS BREMER'S VISIT TO COOPER'S LANDING," "GETTING INTO
SOCIETY," "MUSTARD TO MIX," ETC. ETC.


"ISN'T it perfect?" said young Mrs. Murden, drawing her husband towards a
shop window as she herself made a halt in front of it. "I think it is the
loveliest shade I ever saw, and that satin stripe gives it such an air so
perfectly genteel!"

"What?" asked Mr. Murden, simply, roused from his calculation of
percentage on certain articles just consigned to him. "It" was certainly
an indefinite pronoun, with all that display of elegant silks, ribbons,
laces, and embroideries, so skilfully arranged to attract the promenaders
of Chestnut Street.

"Why, that silk. I've stopped to look at it twice this week."

"That blue and red plaid? Yes, it is very handsome; just the pattern of
your woollen shawl, isn't it?"

"Plaids!" exclaimed Mrs. Murden, contemptuously. "Why, that's only a
dollar silk; besides, everybody wears plaids--they're _so common_!"

"Then a thing is not pretty when it's common?"

"Why, of course not. I heard Mrs. George Barker say yesterday that no real
lady wore such gay colors on the street; that, in Paris, plain colors are
all the rage. I mean that rich purple, with the thick satin stripe. It's
perfect."

Young Mrs. Murden had thought the plaids the very height of fashion, until
she overheard this conversation between Mrs. George Barker and her mother.
Who should know what was stylish, if Mrs. George Barker did not, when she
lived in a house with a marble front, had a coachman in livery, and the
family arms, done in the best manner, on the panel of her crimson lined
carriage?

People said she had made a mistake in the last, however; that the
stately swan of the crest should have been a tailor's goose. But, then,
these were people who had no carriage of their own, and were obliged
to patronize omnibuses. No doubt, if they could have afforded it, the
paternal awl and lapstone would have been transposed into a dagger and
shield, in a similar manner; so their opinion is no manner of consequence.

Mrs. Murden had gone into Evans & Gilman's to "price," as she called it,
the very plaid she now scorned--for her best silk was giving way--when she
overheard its sentence pronounced by those red lips, with a shrug of the
sable-caped shoulders of the fashionable lady. Mrs. Barker pronounced the
purple "exceedingly stylish;" Mrs. Murden "caught the verdict as it fell;"
and, from that moment, her affections were centred upon it.

Not that she had any claims to being stylish herself; on the contrary,
her little home, in a far away cross street, was exceedingly plain; but
the young wife had undeveloped aspirations towards a less humble sphere,
shown by being, in some sort, a leader of the circle in which she visited.
It was not large, or very select, but there were some well-educated,
well-bred people, some very warm, true hearts, and, as the case will
always be, others as empty-minded, selfish, and frivolous as if they were
really in fashionable life. Mrs. Murden, as her husband sometimes noticed,
had rather an inclination to court the latter party, as they dressed and
furnished the most showily, and, in fact, to outvie them--a disposition
which the far-sighted Mr. Murden dreaded not a little.

He was decidedly a domestic man, and, besides, as his wife often said,
so her dress was put on properly, with a clean collar and undersleeves,
he did not know half the time whether it was silk or calico. Indeed, he
had brought quite a serious attack of pouting upon himself, by calling
his wife's new green foulard a calico. You may be sure, he had entirely
forgotten that purple silks were ever manufactured by the next day at
dinner, when he was reminded of it by Mrs. Murden abruptly terminating a
long fit of musing by the exclamation--

"I should be perfectly happy, if I had it."

Mr. Murden, foolish man, supposed at first that she meant a picture of the
children, who were marvellously near of an age--two of them.

"Well, dear, when shall we take them down to Root's? Say the word." For
Mr. Murden himself thought it a great pity that such remarkable beauty
should be lost to the world. No doubt, Root would insist on a duplicate
for his show-case.

"Root's! I was talking about _that silk_, Mr. Murden. What has Root got
to do with it, I'd like to know?" Mrs. Murden seemed inclined to help to
tarts before the dessert was served.

"Oh!" And Mr. Murden resumed his carver, helping himself to a second cut
of beef. "Bless my soul, how much women do think of dress! Who's going to
have a new one?"

"It's high time I had, dear. Only think, we've been married three years
next month, and I've only had one silk in that while."

"Why, you had one in the summer--that striped frock and cape."

"That's an India; we don't call these thin things anything. I mean a good,
heavy _poult de soie_, like my mazarine blue I had when we were married.
It's fairly gone now, careful as I have been. It's been turned and
cleaned, and now it's so shabby I hate to put it on."

"I'm sure, you never look better in any dress you've got," insisted Mr.
Murden, who had very pleasant associations connected with their early
married life and the dress in question.

"Why, it's a perfect fringe around the bottom, and has two great stains on
the skirt. What are you thinking of, John?"

"Well, well, I'll give it up. I like it, that's all. How much will a new
one cost?"

Mrs. Murden, slightly diplomatic, could not present an estimate. Her
husband had told her of a business loss when he came in; it was not a very
favorable moment.

Wonderful as it seemed to her, the purple silk was still unsold when a
week had passed; but, then, it is a color very few dare to try their
complexions by, which Mrs. Murden did not reflect upon. The celebrated
"Purple Jar" was not more attractive to "Rosamond," as chronicled by Miss
Edgeworth, than was the dress to its constant worshipper, who made an
errand into Chestnut Street daily that she might pause for a moment before
it. Mr. Murden said she reminded him of his father's old pony, who always
halted of his own accord at the houses of the doctor's principal patients.
Mrs. Murden "did not thank him" for any such comparisons.

That same evening there was a perceptible rise of spirits observable in
the father of the family. He tossed the baby, accordingly, so far that its
anxious mother was sure its poor little head would be dashed against the
ceiling; he gave George Washington, the eldest hope, three several rides
on his boot, and carried him up to bed in a fashion best known to nurses
as "pig-a-back." Mrs. Murden wondered what had happened; she little knew
the good fortune in store for her.

"Well, Barney"--Mr. Murden always called his wife Barney when in
particularly good humor, though her name was a very romantic one, Adelaide
Matilda--"how about that dress? Tell us, out and out, how much it would
cost. Let's see if it would break a fellow."

"It's a splendid piece," began Mrs. Murden.

"So I have been told every day for two weeks."

"You know I'm not _very_ extravagant; and, once in a while, dear, I _do_
take a fancy for something handsome."

Mr. Murden thought the proposition would have been stated correctly,
if she had said, "every little while;" but Mrs. Murden was warming his
slippers for him, and looking very pretty in the bright firelight, so he
made no ungracious comment; he only said--

"Come, Barney, out with it. What's the entire figure?"

"Well, it's a two dollar silk, I find"--Mrs. Murden made a desperate
attempt to look unconcerned--"and it will take ten yards."

"Whew!" Mr. Murden had thought a ten dollar gold piece would have been
all-sufficient, and was turning one over in his pocket at the moment.
"Why, as much as an overcoat almost."

"And will last twice as long, dear; just remember that."

"Well, well, for once in my life--there's a nice piece of extravagance;
but, as you've set your heart upon it, you shall be indulged, Barney. Take
them both." And he dropped the two eagles, received that afternoon for
what he had considered a bad debt, into her outstretched hand.

It was thus that Mrs. Murden came into possession of her two dollar silk,
the envy of her next door neighbor, Mrs. Keyser, her intimate friends,
Mrs. Hopkins and Miss Lippincott, to whom it was shown in the piece.

"How are you going to have it made?" asked Mrs. Keyser. "I'd have a
basque, by all means, and have it open." Mrs. Keyser was one of those
ladies who accomplish so much on a committee of foreign affairs, and so
little in the home department.

"Oh, so would I," said Miss Lippincott, who always assented to everything
that was said.

"I don't believe a basque would be becoming," enviously interposed Mrs.
Hopkins, who was herself remarkably stout and dumpy in figure.

"Perhaps not," said Miss Lippincott; "very likely not."

"I don't believe Miss Johns could fit a basque either," pursued Mrs.
Hopkins, who had no intention of being outdone by her neighbor; _her_
dresses were all made for the winter.

"Nor I," added Miss Lippincott.

"I wouldn't trust Miss Johns to put scissors into _that_ silk anyhow,"
Mrs. Keyser said; for, having relations living in Spruce Street, she was
considered to have unusual claims to knowingness in matters of fashion,
and was not slow to put them forth.

"Surely," thought Mrs. Murden, "it never would do. Miss Johns was well
enough for a plain dress; but a _two dollar silk!_"

"How I wish you could afford to have it made at Miss Stringer's now,"
continued Mrs. Keyser. "Emma Louisa always has everything done there, and
so does Mrs. Coleman, she's so intimate with, and Mrs. George Barker. You
never saw such splendid fits."

It is presumed that Mrs. Keyser did _not_ allude to convulsions; but Mrs.
Hopkins always elevated her little flat _nez_ on a mention of these Spruce
Street relatives; for every one knows she said to Miss Lippincott, as they
walked down the street together--

"Every one knows that she never is invited there when any one else is
expected, not even to the wedding. _I_ wouldn't own such relations, if I
had shoals of them; would you, Miss Lippincott?"

"No, indeed," returned that lady, with unusual animation for her, for she
was rather worn out with allusions to the Spruce Street relations herself,
in an intimacy of some months' standing.

It was a very daring thing, but young Mrs. Murden, revolving all these
things in her mind, the basque, the open front, Miss Johns's lack of
style, and that she was employed by all her acquaintances, came to the
conclusion that her dress should be made at a Chestnut Street shop,
although she had never had anything made out of the house before. "But
it's once in a lifetime," as she said to Mr. Murden, walking down with
him after dinner; and he, who had never seen a fashionable mantuamaker's
bill, thought it of very little consequence to whom the important
commission was intrusted.

The little woman felt rather nervous, it is true, on entering such awful
precincts as the shop of Miss Stringer, which was by no means diminished
by the manner of the lady in waiting, who pursued, at the same time, her
gossip with another damsel seated in the window with a "dummy" on her
knee, shaping a cap on its unconscious head, not less empty, perhaps, than
the one it was destined to grace.

"I should like a dress made, if you could do it," stammered forth Mrs.
Murden as the girl leisurely surveyed her from head to foot, taking an
exact inventory of her dress, and knowing to a fraction the cost of every
article.

"Certainly, madam." And then over her shoulder to the cap-maker at the
window: "Is it possible that she has white feathers on a blue bonnet? I
wouldn't wear such a thing myself. Who's with her?"

"Young Rushton," returned the street surveyor, turning dummy's blank face
for another fold of lace. "He's devoted, they say."

"I beg your pardon, madam." It was not a pardon asked for inattention, but
a suggestion to Mrs. Murden to finish her business.

"A dress," continued Mrs. Murden, falteringly. "When could you make it?"

"Next week, or week after, perhaps, or early next month. You can call
on Wednesday, and Miss Stringer will make an appointment to fit you,"
vouchsafed the attendant with the Jenny Lind silk apron. "You can send
round the material in the mean time. Street or evening-dress?"

Strictly speaking, Mrs. Murden never had had an evening-dress; her silks
were worn to the parties she usually attended. She had the precious
purchase with her, and she considered it quite handsome enough for any
ball that ever was given; but she would not have offered it to the young
woman then on any consideration. She felt convicted of carrying her own
bundles, and consequently carried this one home again, to be left next day
by Mr. Murden on his way to the store.

Wednesday, and Mrs. Murden, dressed in her best, waited again upon Miss
Stringer. This time, the lady herself appeared, and proved not to be
quite so _withering_ as her assistant--principals seldom are. There were
several fashionable ladies in waiting, all on the most gossipping and
familiar terms with Miss Stringer, who was besieged with petitions for
impossible work to be done in incredible haste, enforced by "You kind,
good creature," and other terms of endearment written in the wheedling
vocabulary. According to their piteous statements, not one of these
splendidly attired women had a dress to cover them, or a cloak to shield
them from the cold. Mrs. Murden had a fine opportunity of seeing and
hearing while she waited exactly one hour for Miss Stringer. She had
never been in such close contact with fashionable women before. Like many
others of her own position in life, they had always been her envy and her
admiration from a distance, as they swept across the pavement from their
carriages, or brushed past her at the entrance of Bailey's or Levy's, at
whose fascinating windows she was spell-bound. They could not have a wish
ungratified, she was sure; their lives must pass like a fairy tale, all
flowers and music. But, now that she saw them nearer, the wan and restless
eyes, the half hidden wrinkles painfully distended in the glare of a
bright winter's morning, and the querulous, fretful tones, told another
story.

"They were tired to death"--they whose feet scarcely touched the pavement,
and who had servants at every call. "The party of last night was so
stupid!" "The ball of Thursday wouldn't be worth the trouble of dressing
for." "What should they wear? Miss Stringer must tell them." "Did she know
Rushton's engagement was broken with Bell Hamilton? Her ill health, it was
said; but every one knew, because he had been flirting so all winter with
Mrs. McCord. But then she had such a brute of a husband, Coleman McCord,
who could blame her? He was devoted to the southern beauty, Miss Legree."
"Was lemon color quite out of date? and should they get crimson fuchsias
with gold tips for the wreath?"

Mrs. Murden was so deep in moral reflections suggested by this style of
conversation, that she did not perceive Miss Stringer was ready for her
at first. She was almost sorry when the moment arrived, for she dreaded
an interview with this maker of fine ladies, who dictated to them so
coolly, and was so besieged, and coaxed, and petted by them. The lady's
distant, preoccupied manner added to her embarrassment, when, finding she
had an unoccupied half hour, she proposed to fit her forthwith, and asked
Mrs. Murden into the inner apartment, with its curtains and lounges, its
cheval glass reflecting the little woman's figure from head to foot, and
reminding her that the dress she wore was at least two inches shorter
than the flowing robes of the birds of paradise who had just taken their
departure. Silly little body, she felt so awkward and old-fashioned,
and wished in her heart she was in her own back parlor, with Miss Johns
and her heart-shaped pin-cushion. She was quite a mirror of fashion to
Miss Johns, who was indebted to Mrs. Murden for half her new sleeves and
trimmings, caught by those observing black eyes, and shaped out at home
with the aid of old newspapers. But here it was the mantuamaker's place to
dictate.

"A basque, of course, or is it an evening-dress? What name?"

"Murden--Mrs. Murden." And she knew perfectly well it was one entirely
foreign to the ears that caught it, low as was her tone. But when Miss
Stringer came to see that silk her opinion might change. Mrs. Murden
longed to have it brought forth and note the effect.

"A silk; for the street, I suppose? Basque, of course. We only make
bodices in full dress. Open body?" And Miss Stringer's rapid fingers
measured the shoulders, the waist, the arms, presented to her,
mechanically. Customers were but lay figures to the fashionable _modiste_,
to be made up at pleasure. "Miss Elbert, Mrs. Murden's silk."

But Miss Elbert feigned entire ignorance of its reception. "Mrs.
Murden--she could not remember the name." And a bustle of search ensued,
while the forewoman from the work-room made her appearance for orders,
bringing skirts and waists of such rich and dazzling materials as Mrs.
Murden had never dreamed of, while she trembled for the fate of her own
precious purple. Two errand girls, charity children they looked like,
with their little sharp, thin faces and faded shawls, were dispatched to
match buttons, and gimps, and galloons, with handsful of patterns, and
heads full of instructions, which last did not stay where they were put,
which accounted for Miss Lawrence appearing at the Thursday ball with
yellow fringe on a lemon-colored dress, and Mrs. Johnson Rogers finding
her gray silk--she was in half mourning for the late lamented Mr. Johnson
Rogers--decorated by brown velvet acorn buttons. However, both passed for
Parisian novelties, and were greatly admired; so Miss Stringer, and not
the stupid errand girls, who came back too late to admit of a change,
received the credit of these novel decorations.

Much to Mrs. Murden's relief, the silk was at last forthcoming, from an
out-of-the-way drawer, and she awaited with inward satisfaction Miss
Stringer's inspection. But two-dollar silks were everyday bread and butter
to that lady, who merely glanced at it, and tossed the package upon a
neighboring sofa, as if it had been so many yards of crash towelling.

"Very good quality," she remarked. "You got it at Evans & Gilman's. Trying
to most complexions. _What now_, Miss Elbert? No, I shall not _touch_ Mrs.
Cadwalader's dress before Monday. Tell her she can wear her white _moire
d'antique_; she's only worn it twice this season to my knowledge. Tell her
to wear her Honiton scarf, and no one will know what kind of a dress she
has on. That will do, Mrs.--I beg your pardon--Mudon. You can come again
on Thursday week. How will you have it trimmed?"

Mrs. Murder did not venture to suggest a trimming, and prudently left the
whole matter to Miss Stringer's abler hands. Prudently, in one sense; she
had never seen a bill from a fashionable shop, recollect. She had been
just about to inquire what Miss Stringer would charge. Fortunate escape!
The question would have been met with paralyzing coldness. It is a risk
to procure your own trimming; but to seek to place a limit as to ultimate
expense--unpardonable in the eyes of an autocrat of fashion.

So Mrs. Murden departed very much cast down, and very insignificant in
her cashmere dress and the fur she had thought so handsome--so it was in
her own set; but her eyes had been dwelling upon velvet cloaks and sable
victorines the past two hours. Alas! for her last year's mantle, pretty as
it had been; embroidered merinos looked so _common_--fatal word.

Miss Stringer had entirely forgotten the appointment when she presented
herself again on Thursday week. Meantime, it had been very difficult
to parry the inquiries of her trio of intimates as to when and how the
dress was to be made, without betraying her all-important secret. But she
succeeded to admiration. It was in vain for Mrs. Hopkins to remark that
Miss Johns was engaged for nearly all the week, to her certain knowledge,
or for Mrs. Keyser to allude to Emma Louisa's green poplin, the "sweetest"
thing she had ever seen; Mrs. Murden did not give out a clue. She saw
the identical green poplin at Miss Stringer's, on her second audience,
and heard Miss Elbert remark, with her accustomed freedom, upon its
possessor, who was set down by Miss Stringer's young woman as decidedly
vulgar and over-dressed. Mrs. Keyser never would have survived overhearing
this assault upon her kinswoman. Mrs. Murden treasured it up for future
remembrance.

"It does make me sick," remarked Miss Elbert, "to see people load on such
things. Thank my stars, I'm not a rich woman! Poor things, I pity them!
in a fever from morning till night about a dress or a cloak. Half of them
murder the king's English. Don't you say so, Miss Replier?"

Miss Replier, who still fitted "dummy" to one unending round of caps,
assented with a nod.

"Then they're so afraid some one else will have something," continued
this free-spoken, candid young person. "Did you see Mrs. James Thomas,
the day of our opening, take up that garnet hat Miss Stringer had ordered
out for Mrs. McCord? Mrs. McCord wouldn't have it, after all, when she
heard there was one made from it. And there's Miss Thornton thinks she's
got the only _Eugenie_ robe in the country. Levy imported three to my
certain knowledge. For my part, it makes me sick as the head boy at a
confectioner's. If I was as rich as Mrs. Rush, I wouldn't have a thing
better than I have now." And here she condescended to see if Miss Stringer
was disengaged, and ushered the possessor of the purple silk into the
fitting-room.

It was quite a picture as Mrs. Murden entered it. The lounges spread
with dresses that surpassed her imagination. Two bonnets, all lace and
flowers, the frame seeming only intended to support them, were on stands
in one corner, and wreaths, gloves, ribbons, and embroideries made up the
graceful confusion. Miss Stringer was on her knees before a large deal
box, folding and packing these wonderful creations.

"A bridal order," she said, "for the South. Look around, if you would like
to."

Mrs. Murden would not have touched any of them for a kingdom; it seemed
as if a breath would soil the gossamer-like evening-dresses, with their
light garlands of flowers. A velvet robe fit for a queen, destined for the
mother of the bride; a morning-dress of French cambric embroidery, over a
violet-colored silk; flounced dresses, with borders of woven embroidery,
in the most delicate contrasting shade; glove-knots, shoulder-knots,
breast-knots, of ribbon and gold lace, were some of the items of this
costly _trousseau_.

The cherished purple silk faded, as if it had been exposed to a summer
sun, in Mrs. Murden's eyes. It looked so very "_common_"--to think of a
two dollar silk being common--beside those brocades and flounced taffetas,
when it came to be tried on; and then the prices dealt out in the most
amiable manner by Miss Stringer conscious that she had made a good thing
of it.

The velvet had cost a hundred dollars "before scissors had touched it."
The lace on the skirt of the bridal-dress was seventy-five dollars a
yard; the morning-dress was a robe imported, of course, at sixty dollars;
and so on to the ermine-bordered mantle, at four hundred and fifty.

Mrs. Murden asked when her dress would be sent home, as she resumed her
bonnet and cloak. She had lost nearly all interest in it, as Miss Stringer
pulled and puckered, let out, and let in, the nicely fitting basque. It
was not lost, perhaps, but swallowed up for the time in the contemplation
of so much elegance, which, come what would, she could never hope to
attain. And she colored, we grieve to record it, as she gave the lynx-eyed
Miss Elbert her address, so far away from the fashionable quarter. Perhaps
she saw the glance exchanged with Miss Replier as it was named.

Mrs. Murden anticipated the arrival of the purple silk with dread
forebodings. She hoped her husband would not be at home if the bill came
with it. "Making up" was a trifle when she sewed with Miss Johns, and
found her own trimmings. She knew that Mr. Murden had not calculated on
any extra demands, the dress once purchased. Besides, he had been losing
money all the week, and besides, she had anticipated the last dollar of
her month's allowance. She was more abstracted than ever as the time drew
near.

But it came, and there was no help for it--on Saturday evening, the night
of all others when Mr. Murden was sure to be at home. It was very, very
stylish; the trimming, a broad embossed velvet ribbon, matched the shade
to perfection. Mr. Murden wanted to have it tried on at once, and did
not think the absence of a chemisette detracted at all from the _tout
ensemble_.

He felt very much pleased with himself for having allowed his pretty wife
to have her own way, and gave her a kiss by way of approval to her taste,
which chaste matrimonial salute was interrupted by the reappearance of
their one servant, to say that the girl was waiting in the hall, as the
bill was receipted.

"Ah, the bill!" There it was, pinned conspicuously on the flap of the
basque. Mr. Murden detached it, and read the amount: "$13 29 cts. Received
payment, Ann Stringer."

"Good gracious, my dear, what a mistake! More than half as much as the
dress cost!"

Mrs. Murden caught at the straw. Perhaps it was a mistake, and the wrong
bill had been sent to her. But there was no such good fortune; there it
was, in Miss Elbert's own hard, angular handwriting, item by item. And Mr.
Murden paid it on the spot, for he never allowed a bill to be presented
twice; but he went out without returning to the parlor, and shut the
front door with a bang, to countermand the new overcoat which he had been
measured for that afternoon, and which he needed badly.

It was weeks before the purple silk was again alluded to by him, and
spring before Mrs. Murden could afford to purchase undersleeves and a
chemisette to wear with it. She walked to church in the mazarine blue
beside the shabby overcoat, with its threadbare sleeves and rusty collar,
a humbler and a better woman. It was only when Mr. Murden discovered what
a cure the surfeit of finery in Mrs. Stringer's fitting-room had wrought,
that he quite pardoned the folly and extravagance of the purple silk.
"For," as Mrs. Murden said, "there must always be a great many people
better dressed, spend what she would, so where was the use? And, after
all, comfort was the thing, not show."

The purple silk became quite a favorite eventually, for Mr. Murden did not
consider the lesson dearly bought at thirty-three dollars and twenty-nine
cents, since it was to last a lifetime.

MANAGEMENT OF CANARY BIRDS.

BY request of a correspondent, we publish the following from Mrs. Hale's
"New Household Receipt-Book:"--

"Canary birds that are kept tame will breed three or four times in the
year. Towards the middle of March begin to match your birds, putting one
cock and hen into the breeding-cage, which should be large, so that the
birds may have room to fly and exercise themselves. Place two boxes or
little basket-nests in the cage, for the hen to lay her eggs in, because
she will sometimes have a second brood before the first are fit to fly,
leaving the care of them to the father bird, who feeds and brings them up
with much care, while she is sitting on her second nest of eggs. Whilst
your birds are pairing feed them, besides the usual seeds, with the yolks
of hard-boiled eggs, bread that has been moistened, or, if hard, grated
fine, and pounded almond-meat. When the young birds are to be fed, give
the same soft food, and be sure have it fresh every day; also furnish
the old birds with fresh greens, such as cabbage-lettuce, chickweed,
groundsel, &c. Give fresh water every day, and a clean bath every morning.
The hen lays, commonly, four or five eggs, and sits fourteen days. When
the young are hatched, leave them to the care of the old birds to nurse
and bring up till they can fly and feed themselves, which is, usually, in
about twenty days."

the bases of the ornamental sketch shown in Fig. 37. In like manner,
the half-ellipse, formed on the horizontal line in Fig. 38, is the
foundation of the sketch shown in Fig. 39. So also is the foundation of
a flower-petal, shown in Fig. 40, made clear by the analytical sketch
in Fig. 41, where the preliminary forms are shown drawn. Again, the
ornamental scroll in Fig. 42 is drawn by sketching a half-ellipse on the
horizontal line.

[Illustration: Fig. 40.]

The convolvulus flower and stem in Fig. 43 are also drawn by previously
sketching an ellipse to form the flower.

[Illustration: Fig. 41.]

[Illustration: Fig. 42.]

In sketching the flower in Fig. 44, the pupil must first draw an outline
which will take in the whole figure, making it as near the shape of the
sketch as the eye dictates. After the correct outline is formed, the
details must be drawn.

[Illustration: Fig. 48.]

[Illustration: Fig. 49.]

The flower, stem, and leaves of the sketch in Fig. 45 must be drawn in,
the form being estimated chiefly by the eye; the stem ought to be put in
first, thereafter the distances between the leaves, and then filling in
the details. The ivy-leaf in Fig. 46 is to be drawn in the same way as
the last. The ivy-stem and leaves shown in Fig. 47 should be drawn by
first sketching out the length, form, and direction of the stem, then
ascertaining and marking the distances between the leaves, and filling in
the details as before. The leaf in Fig. 48, and the leaves in Fig. 49,
should next be copied. Fig. 50 is the leaf of the common "dock." It is to
be copied by first drawing an ellipse, thereafter filling in the details.
Fig. 51 is the stem and leaves of the "burdock." The sketch may be put in
at once by the assistance of the eye; it may be better, however, to draw a
circle for the part _a_, and an ellipse for that of _b_.

[Illustration: Fig. 50.]

[Illustration: Fig. 51.]

The scroll in Fig. 52 may be sketched by drawing an outline which would
touch all the parts of the design, thereafter filling up the details.

[Illustration: Fig. 52.]

[Illustration: Fig. 53.]

In drawing the sketch shown in Fig. 53, the pupil will have to trust
greatly to the eye. The stem should be drawn first, its length and
direction being carefully noted; the distances of the extremities of
the leaves from the stem should next be marked off; next, their general
outline, and thereafter the details. The proportions the parts bear to one
another must be attended to.




THE TRIALS OF A NEEDLEWOMAN.[2]

BY T. S. ARTHUR.

(Continued from page 227.)


CHAPTER VI.

THE efforts made by Perkins to find the residence of the stranger proved
unavailing. Half suspecting that Michael had deceived him, he returned to
the shop of Mr. Berlaps, and asked the direction anew. It was repeated
precisely as at first given.

"But I have been there."

"Well, wasn't she at that number?"

"No."

"I don't know anything about her, then. It often happens that these
sewing-girls deceive us as to their whereabouts."

Perkins turned away disappointed, but with his interest in the stranger
more than ever excited.

"Who and what can she be? and why do I feel so deep an interest in a
perfect stranger, who cannot possibly be anything to me?" were involuntary
questions which the young man endeavored, but in vain, to answer.

That night, as he sat alone in his room, his friend Milford came in and
found him with the miniature before alluded to in his hand.

"Whose sweet face is that? Bless me! But she is a lovely creature!" said
Milford, as his eye caught a glimpse of the picture which Perkins made a
movement to conceal. "Aha! Mr. Sobersides! have I found you out at last?"

But seeing that his remarks had the effect to disturb, even agitate his
friend, he said, in a changed tone--

"Forgive me if I have thoughtlessly jarred a string that vibrates
painfully! I knew not that you carried in your heart an unhealed wound."

"And yet I do, my friend. A wound that, I fear, will never cicatrize. Five
years have passed since I parted with the living original of this picture.
The parting was to be only for a few months. We have never met since, and
never will, in this world! The sea gives not up its dead!"

There was a solemn earnestness in the voice of Perkins that showed how
deeply the loss still affected him.

"To me," said his companion, after a pause, "it seems strange that you
should never have alluded to this subject, even to your nearest friend."

"I could not, Milford. The effort to keep my feelings under control has
been severe enough, without permitting myself to speak of the matter at
all. But now that it has been alluded to, I feel inclined to talk upon the
subject, if you have any desire to hear."

"I certainly have an anxious desire to hear," replied Milford.

Perkins shaded his face for a few moments with his hand, and sat silent
and thoughtful. He then gave, in a calm voice, the following narration:--

"You are aware that, when I came to this city to reside, a few years
since, I removed from Troy, New York. That is my native place--or, at
least, I had lived there from boyhood up, when I removed to Boston. It is
now about ten years since a man named Ballantine, who seemed to possess
considerable wealth, made his appearance in the place, accompanied by
his daughter, a young girl about thirteen years of age. He came from
New Orleans, where his wife had died, and where he was still engaged in
business. His object in coming north with his child was to secure for
her the advantages of a good seminary. He seemed to prefer Troy, and
after remaining there for some months, concluded to place his child in
the family of a newly-married man, whose wife, somewhat matronly in age
and in habits, happened to please his fancy, as a maternal guardian for
his child. After making every requisite arrangement in regard to her
education, he returned to New Orleans, from which city money to defray her
expenses was regularly transmitted. Once a year he came north to visit
her, and remained in our town for a few weeks.

"I happened to know the family in which Eugenia Ballantine was placed,
and became acquainted with her immediately. I was then but a boy,
though some four years her senior, yet old enough to feel for her, from
the beginning, something more than a mere fraternal regard. And this
sentiment was reciprocal. No place was so pleasant to me as that which was
cheered by her presence--no smile warmed my heart like her smile; and I
could always see her countenance brighten the moment I came where she was.

"Gradually, as year after year passed, and she still remained among us,
our early preference for each other, or rather our early affection,
assumed a more serious character. We loved each other; she was just
seventeen, and I twenty-one, when I ventured to tell her how deeply,
fervently, and purely I loved her. The formal announcement did not seem to
create surprise, or agitate her in the least.

"'I never doubted it,' was her innocent reply, looking me tenderly in the
face.

"'And do you love me as truly as I love you, Eugenia?' I asked.

"'Have you ever doubted it?' was her quiet response to this, also.

"From that moment I was bewilderingly happy. My family was one of wealth
and standing, and I immediately wrote to Mr. Ballantine, who, after
sufficient time to make inquiry in regard to the character and position
of his daughter's lover, returned a cordial assent to my proposal for her
hand. Thus far everything had gone on as smoothly as a summer sea. We
smiled sometimes together at the carping adage, 'The course of true love
never did run smooth,' and referred to our own case as a signal instance
of its falsity.

"During the summer succeeding our engagement, Mr. Ballantine did not come
on to the north. In the ensuing spring, Eugenia's term of instruction
closed at the seminary, after having been in Troy nearly five years. She
was a tall, beautiful woman, with a mind highly cultivated, and externally
accomplished in every respect. I was proud of her beauty and acquirements,
at the same time that I loved her with fervent devotion. Spring passed
away and summer came; with the advancing season her father arrived from
the south. He had not seen his child for two years, during which time she
had grown up into a mature and lovely woman. I could forgive the jealous
pride with which he would look into her face, and the constant tenderness
of his allusions to her when she was away from his side.

"'I do not think, Mr. Perkins,' he would say to me, sometimes, 'that I can
let you have my Eugenia, unless you will go south. I am sure I cannot part
with her again.'

"'Why not come north, Mr. Ballantine?' I would suggest.

"But he would shake his head as he made some disparaging remark in regard
to the north, and playfully insist that I must go with him to the sunny
south. It was about the first of September that I asked that our marriage
might take place at an early day. But the father shook his head.

"'Be content that the flower is to be yours. Do not become too eager to
pluck it from its parent stem. I must have my dear girl with me for at
least one winter. In the spring she shall be yours.'

"'Oh, no! Mr. Ballantine,' I said, in alarm, 'you are not going to rob me
of her for so long a time?' I spoke with warmth.

"'Rob you of her!' ejaculated the father, in seeming half indignation.
'You are unreasonable and very selfish, my dear boy! Here you have had her
for five years, and after a little while are to have her for life, and yet
are unwilling to give me even the boon of a few short months with my own
child. You are not generous!'

"I felt the rebuke, and confessed that I had been moved by too selfish
feelings.

"'If you think the time long,' he added, 'all you have to do is to take a
packet and come round--we shall welcome you with joy.'

"'That I shall no doubt be compelled to do, for I will not be able to
exist for five or six long months away from Eugenia.'

"'So I should suppose. Well, come along, and after I get you there, I will
see if I can't inoculate you with a love of Southern people, Southern
habits, and Southern manners. I am sanguine that you will like us.'

"'Well, perhaps so,' I said. 'But we will see.'

"The time for the departure of Mr. Ballantine and his daughter was set
for the first of October. The few remaining days passed on fleet wings,
and then, after completing the necessary arrangements, Eugenia left Troy
with her father for New York, thence to go by sea to her native city.
I accompanied them down the river, and spent two days with them in the
city, previous to the sailing of the ship Empress, in which they were to
embark. Our parting was tender, yet full of hope for a speedy meeting. I
had already made up my mind to visit New Orleans about January, and remain
there during the winter. Our marriage was then to be solemnized.

"After the sailing of the Empress, I returned to Troy, to await the news
of her safe arrival at New Orleans. I felt gloomy and desolate, and for
my uncompanionable humor received sundry playful jibes or open rebukes
from my friends. In about a week I began to examine the shipping lists of
the New York papers, in the hope of seeing some notice of the good ship
that contained my heart's best treasure. But no record of her having been
spoken at sea met my eyes as I scanned the newspapers day after day with
an eager and increasing hope, until four, five, and six weeks had passed
away. So much troubled had I now become, that I went down to New York to
see the owners of the ship.

"'Has the Empress arrived out yet?' I asked, on entering their
counting-room.

"'Not at the latest dates,' was the reply, made in a voice expressive of
concern.

"'Is not her passage a very long one?'

"'We should have had news of her arrival ten days ago.'

"'Has she been spoken on the passage?'

"'Never but once, and that after she was three days out.'

"'Is she a good ship?' I next inquired.

"'None better out of this port,' was the prompt answer.

"For ten days I remained in New York, eagerly examining each morning the
shipping lists, and referring to all the southern papers to which I could
get access. I met during that time but one reference to the Empress,
and that was contained in a paragraph alluding to her long passage, and
expressing great fears for her safety. This thrilled my heart with a
more palpable and terrible fear. On the next day but one, I met in a New
Orleans paper a farther allusion to her, coupled with the remark that a
suspicious-looking vessel, clipper-built, with a black hull, had been
seen several times during the past few weeks cruising in the Gulf, and
expressing a fear lest she had come across the Empress. I thought this
would have driven me beside myself. But why prolong this painful narration
by attempting to describe my feelings, as day after day, week after week,
and month after month passed, and no tidings came of the missing ship?
From the day I parted with Eugenia, I have neither seen her nor heard
from her. The noble vessel that bore her proudly away neither reached her
destination, nor returned back with her precious freight. All--all found a
grave in the dark depths of the ocean.

"It is a terrible thing, my friend, to be _thus_ reft of all you hold
dearest in life. If I had seen her touched by the hand of disease, and
watched the rose fading from her cheek, leaf after leaf falling away,
until death claimed at last his victim, I could have borne the severe
affliction with some degree of fortitude. Even if she had been struck down
suddenly at my side, there would have been something for the bruised heart
to rest upon. But to be taken from me thus! her fate shrouded in a most
fearful mystery! Oh! it is terrible!"

And the young man set his teeth firmly, and clenched his hands, in a
powerful struggle with his still o'ermastering feelings. At length he
resumed, in a calmer voice--

"No matter what terrors or violence attended her death--no matter how deep
she lies in the unfathomable sea, her spirit is with the blessed angels,
for she was pure and good. This ought to be enough for me. The agonies of
a fearful departure are long since over. And why should I recall them,
and break up afresh the tender wounds that bleed at the slightest touch?
Henceforth I will strive to look away from the past, and onward, in
pleasing hope, to that future time when we shall meet where there will be
no more parting."

"She must have been a lovely creature, indeed," said Milford, some minutes
after his friend had ceased, holding, as he spoke, the miniature in his
hand, and looking at it attentively.

"She was lovely as innocence itself," was the half abstracted reply.

"Although I never saw her, yet there is an expression in her face that
is familiar"--Milford went on to say--"very familiar; but it awakens, I
cannot tell why, a feeling of pain. This face is a happy face; and yet it
seems every moment as if it would change into a look of sadness--yea, of
deep sorrow and suffering."

"This may arise, and no doubt does, from the melancholy history connected
with her, that I have just related."

"Perhaps that is the reason," Milford returned, thoughtfully. "And yet I
know not how to account for the strangely familiar expression of her face."

"Did you ever see a picture in your life that had not in it some feature
that was familiar?" asked Perkins.

"Perhaps not," the friend replied, and then sat in mental abstraction
for some moments. He was not satisfied with this explanation, and was
searching his memory for the original of that peculiar expression which
had struck him so forcibly. He was sure that it did exist, and that he had
looked upon it no very long time before. But he tried in vain to fix it.
The impression floated still in his mind only as a vague idea.

"There! I have it!" he at length exclaimed, but with something of
disappointment in his tones. "I remember that the young seamstress we were
speaking of a few days ago, a single glimpse of whose face I obtained, had
that very look which strikes me as familiar in this picture. I thought I
had seen it somewhere else."

Perkins started, and looked surprised and agitated. But this was only
momentary.

"Now you speak of her," he said, calmly, "I remember that I always thought
of Eugenia when I saw her, which is no doubt the reason why I have felt
strongly interested for the young stranger, who has doubtless seen better
days. I related to you, I believe, the adventure I had near the bridge, in
which she was concerned?"

"You did. I wonder what in the world takes her over to Charleston so
often? She goes, I believe, almost every day, and usually late in the
afternoon. Several persons have spoken of her to me; but none seemed to
know her errand there, or to have any knowledge of her whatever."

"There is some mystery connected with her, certainly. This afternoon I
went in to make some inquiries in regard to her of Berlaps. I was just in
time to hear Michael, his salesman, give her some insulting language, for
which I rebuked the fellow sharply."

"Indeed! How did she take it?" said Milford.

"She did not seem to notice him, but glided quickly past, as he bent over
the counter towards her, and left the store."

"Did you see her face?"

"No. Her veil was closely drawn, as usual," answered Perkins.

"I don't know why it is, but there is something about this young female
that interests me very much. Have you yet learned her name?"

"It is Lizzy Glenn--so I was told at the clothing store for which she
works."

"Lizzy Glenn? An assumed name, in all probability."

"Very likely. It sounds as if it might be," said Perkins.

"If I were you," remarked the friend, "I would learn something certain
about this stranger; if for no other reason, on account of the singular
association of her, in your involuntary thought, with Miss Ballantine. She
may be a relative; and, if so, it would afford a melancholy pleasure to
relieve her from her present unhappy condition, for the sake of the one in
heaven."

"I have already tried to find her; but she was not at the number where
Michael said she resided."

"She may not have given him the right direction," said Milford.

"So he pretends to infer. But I would rather believe that Michael has
purposely deceived me than that she would be guilty of falsehood."

"If I see her again," said Milford, "I will endeavor, by all means, to
discover her place of residence."

"Do, if you would oblige me. It is my purpose not to lose sight of her
at our next meeting, be it where it may. Our present conversation has
awakened a deeper interest, and stimulated a more active curiosity. I am
no blind believer in chance, Milford. I do not regard this meeting with
the stranger as something only fortuitous. There is a Providence in all
the events of life, and I am now firmly assured that these encounters with
the seamstress are not merely accidental, as the world regards accidents,
but events in a chain of circumstances that, when complete, will result in
positive good. Of the nature of that good--as to who will be blessed or
benefited--I do not pretend to divine. I only feel ready to act my part in
the drama of life. I must and will know more about this stranger."

CHAPTER VII.

AS little Henry, after parting with his mother, hurried on by the side
of Mr. Sharp, who took his way directly across the bridge leading over
to Charleston, where he had left the chaise in which he had ridden from
Lexington, a handsome carriage, containing a mother and three happy
children, about the age of himself, Emma, and the sister who had just
died, drove rapidly by. The children were full of spirits, and, in their
thoughtless glee, called out gayly, but with words of ridicule, to the
poor, meanly clad child, who was hurrying on at almost a run beside the
man who had become his master. Their words, however, were heeded not by
the full-hearted boy. His thoughts were going back to his home, and to his
much-loved mother.

This incident is mentioned here, as a striking illustration of the
practical working of that system of grinding the poor, especially poor
females, by which many men make fortunes, or at least acquire far more
than a simple competence for life. That carriage belonged to Berlaps,
and those happy children were his. But how could he buy a carriage and
horses, and build fine houses, and yet not be able to pay more than the
meagre pittance for his work that the reader has seen doled out to
his half-starving workwomen? How could his children be fed and clothed
sumptuously every day, and the widow, who worked for him from early dawn
until the silent watches of midnight, not be able to get wholesome bread
and warm garments for her little ones, _unless he took more than his just
share_ of the profits upon his goods? If he could only afford to pay seven
cents for coarse shirts, and so on, in proportion, up through the entire
list of articles made, how came it that the profits on these very articles
enabled him to live in elegance, build houses, and keep his own carriage
and horses?

Such questions apply not alone to the single instance of Berlaps, here
introduced. They are pertinent in their application to all who add to
their profits for the purpose of a grand aggregate, at the expense of
reducing the pay, even a few cents, upon the hard toiling workwoman whose
slender income, at best, is barely sufficient to procure the absolute
necessaries of life. This cutting down of women's wages, until they
are reduced to an incompetent pittance, is a system of oppression too
extensive, alas! in this, as well as many other countries. It is one of
the quiet and safe means by which the strong oppress the weak--by which
the selfish build themselves up, cruelly indifferent to the sufferings of
those who are robbed of a just compensation for their labor. The record
of a conversation overheard between two of the class alluded to will
illustrate this matter. They were tailors--or, rather, what are sometimes
called slop-shop or clothing men. Let it not be supposed that tailors
alone are the oppressors of workwomen. In most of the employments at
which females engage, especially such as admit of a competition in labor,
advantage is taken of the eager demands for work, and prices reduced to
the lowest possible standard. In the eager scramble for monopolizing
more than a just share of custom, or to increase the amount of sales by
the temptation of extremely moderate rates, the prices of goods are put
down to the lowest scale they will bear. If, in doing this, the dealer
was content with a profit reduced in some proportion to the increase of
his sales, no one would have a right to complain. He would be free to
sell his goods at cost, or even below cost, if that suited his fancy.
Instead of this, however, the profits on his articles are often the same
that they were when prices were ten or fifteen per cent. higher, and he
reaps the advantage of a greatly increased sale, consequent upon the more
moderate rates at which he can sell. The evil lies in his cutting down
his operatives' wages; in taking off of them, while they make no party to
his voluntary reduction of prices, the precise amount that he throws in
to his customer as a temptation to buy more freely. But to the promised
dialogue:--

"Money don't come in hand-over-fist, as it ought to come," remarked Grasp,
of the flourishing firm of Grasp & Co., Merchant Tailors, of Boston, to
the junior partner of the establishment. "The nimble sixpence is better
than the slow shilling, you know. We must make our shears eat up cloth
a little faster, or we sha'n't clear ten thousand dollars this year by
one-third of the sum."

"Although that would be a pretty decent business these times."

"I don't call any business a decent one that can be bettered," replied
Grasp, contemptuously.

"But can ours be bettered?"

"Certainly!"

"How?"

"By selling more goods."

"How are we to do that?"

"By putting down the prices, and then making a confounded noise about it.
Do you understand?"

"I do. But our prices are very low now."

"True. But we may reduce them still further, and, by so doing, increase
our sales to an extent that will make our business net us beyond the
present income quite handsomely. But, to do this, we must cut down the
prices now paid for making up our clothes. In this way, we shall be able
to greatly increase our sales, with but a slight reduction upon our
present rates of profit."

"But will our workmen stand it? Our needle-women, particularly, work very
low now."

"They'll have to stand it!" replied Grasp; "most of them are glad to get
work at any price. Women, with half a dozen hungry mouths around them,
don't stand long to higgle about a few cents in a garment, when there
are so many willing to step in and take their places. Besides, what are
three or four cents to them on a vest, or pair of pants, or jacket? The
difference in a week is small and will not be missed--or, at the worst,
will only require them to economize with a little steadier hand; while
upon the thousands of garments we dispose of here, and send away to other
markets, it will make a most important aggregate on the right side of
profit and loss."

"There is no doubt of that," replied the partner, the idea of the
aggregate of three or four cents on each garment occupying his mind, and
obscuring completely, for a time, every other idea. "Well, I'm with you,"
he said, after a little while, "in any scheme for increasing profits.
Getting along at the rate of only some two or three thousand a year is
rather slow work. Why, there's Tights, Screw, & Co., see how they're
cutting into the trade, and carrying everything before them. Tights told
me that they cleared twenty thousand dollars last year."

"No doubt of it. And I'll make our house do the same before three years
roll over, or I'm no prophet."

"If we are going to play this cutting down game, we had better begin at
once."

"Oh, certainly. The sooner the better. But first, we must arrange a
reduced scale of prices, and then bring our whole tribe of workwomen and
others down to it at once. It will not do to hold any parley with them. If
we do, our ears will be dinned to death with trumped-up tales of poverty
and distress, and all that sort of thing, with which we have no kind of
concern in the world. These are matters personal to these individuals
themselves, and have nothing to do with our business. No matter what
prices we paid, we would have nothing but grumbling and complaint, if we
allowed an open door on that subject."

"Yes, there is no doubt of that. But, to tell the truth, it is a mystery
to me how some of these women get along. Very few make over two dollars
a week, and some never go beyond a dollar. Many of them are mothers,
and most of them have some one or more dependent upon them. Food, rent,
clothes, and fuel, all have to come out of these small earnings. By what
hocus-pocus it is done, I must confess, puzzles me to determine."

"Oh, as to that," returned Grasp, "it is, no doubt, managed well enough.
Provisions, and everything that poor people stand in need of, are very
cheap. The actual necessaries of life cost but little, you know. How far
above the condition of the starving Irish, or the poor operatives in the
manufacturing portions of England, is that of the people who work for us!
Think of that for a moment."

"True--very true," replied the partner. "Well," he continued, "I think we
had better put the screws on to our workwomen and journeymen at once. I am
tired of plodding on at this rate."

"So am I. To-night, then, after we close the store, we will arrange our
new bill of prices, and next week bring all hands down to it."

And they were just as good as their word. And it happened just as they
said--the poor workmen had to submit.

       *       *       *       *       *

But we must return from our digression.

The child who, under the practical operation of a system of which the
above dialogue gives some faint idea, had to go out from his home at the
tender age of ten years, because his mother, with all her hard toil early
and late, at the prices she obtained for her labor, could not earn enough
to provide a sufficiency of food and clothes for her children--that child
passed on, unheeding, and, indeed, unhearing the jibes of the happier
children of his mother's oppressor, and endeavored, sad and sorrowful
as he felt, to nerve himself with something of a manly feeling. At
Charlestown, Mr. Sharp got into his chaise, and, with the lad he had taken
to raise, drove home.

"Well, here is the youngster, Mrs. Sharp," he said, on alighting from his
vehicle. "He is rather smaller and punier than I like, but I have no doubt
that he will prove willing and obedient."

"What is his name?" asked Mrs. S., who had a sharp chin, sharp nose, and
sharp features throughout; and, with all, rather a sharp voice. She had
no children of her own--those tender pledges being denied her, perhaps on
account of the peculiar sharpness of her temper.

"His name is Henry," replied her husband.

"Henry what?"

"Henry Gaston, I believe. Isn't that it, my boy?"

Henry replied in the affirmative. Mr. Sharp then said--

"You can go in with Mrs. Sharp, Henry. She will tell you what she wants
you to do."

"Yes, come along." And Mrs. Sharp turned away as she spoke, and retired
into the more interior portion of the house, followed by the boy.

"Mrs. Sharp will tell you what she wants you to do!" Yes, that tells
the story. From this hour the child is to become the drudge--the hewer
of wood and drawer of water--for an unfeeling woman, whose cupidity and
that of her husband have prompted them to get a little boy as a matter of
saving--one who could do the errands for the shop and the drudgery for
the house. There was no thought for, and regard towards, the child to be
exercised. He was to be to them only an economical little machine, very
useful, though somewhat troublesome at times.

"I don't see that your mother has killed you with clothes," said Mrs.
Sharp to him, after taking his bundle and examining it, and then surveying
him from head to foot. "But I suppose she thinks they will do well enough;
and I suppose they will. There, do you see that wooden pail there? Well,
I want you to take it and go to the pump across the street, down in the
next square, and bring it full of water."

Henry took the pail, as directed, and went and got the water. This was the
beginning of his service, and was all well enough, as far as it went. But
from that time he had few moments of relaxation, except what the night
gave him, or the quiet Sabbath. All through the first day he was kept busy
either in the house or shop, and, before night, had received two or three
reprimands from Mrs. Sharp, administered in no very affectionate tones.

When night came, at last--it had seemed a very long day to him--and he was
sent to bed alone, in the dark, he put off his clothes and laid himself
down, unable, as he did so, to restrain the tears and sobs. Poor child!
How sadly and yearningly did his heart go back to the narrow apartment,
every nook and corner of which were dear to him, because his mother's
presence made all sunshine there! And how earnestly did he long to be with
her again! But he soon sank away to sleep, from which he did not awaken
until the half angry voice of Mrs. Sharp chided him loudly for "lazing it
away" in bed until after sunrise. Quickly getting up and dressing himself,
he went down and commenced upon a new day of toil. First he had to bring
in wood, then to grind the coffee, afterwards to bring water from the
pump, and then to scour the knives for breakfast. When these were done,
he was sent into the shop to see if Mr. Sharp didn't want him, where he
found plenty to occupy his attention. The shop was to be sprinkled and
swept out, the counter to be dusted, and various other little matters to
be attended to, which occupied him until breakfast-time. After he had
finished this meal, Mrs. Sharp managed to find him plenty to do for some
hours, and then her husband laid out work for him, at which he devoted
himself all the rest of the day, except when he was wanted in the kitchen
for some purpose or other. And so it continued, day after day, from
morning until night. Not an hour's relaxation was allowed the child; and
if, from weariness or disheartened feeling, he sometimes lingered over a
piece of work, a severe scolding or some punishment from Mrs. Sharp was
sure to follow.

Thus things went on, every day adding to the cold of a rapidly advancing
northern winter. But Mrs. Sharp still thought, according to her first
conclusions in regard to Henry's clothes, that "they would do." They were
not very warm, it is true--that she could not help admitting. "But then
he is used to wearing thinner clothes than other children," she reasoned,
"or else his mother would have put warmer ones on him. And, any how,
I see no use in letting him come right down as a dead expense upon our
hands. He hasn't earned his salt yet, much less a suit of winter clothes."

But the poor little fellow was no more used to bearing exposure to the
chilling winds of winter than she had been when a child. He therefore
shrunk shiveringly in the penetrating air whenever forced to go beyond
the door. This did not fail to meet the eye of Mrs. Sharp--indeed,
her eye was rarely off of him when he was within the circle of its
vision--and it always irritated her. And why? It reproved her for not
providing warmer clothes for the child; and hurt her penurious spirits
with the too palpable conviction that before many weeks had passed they
would be compelled to lay out some money for "the brat," as she had
begun frequently to designate him to her husband, especially when she
felt called upon to complain of him for idleness, carelessness, dulness,
stupidity, wastefulness, uncleanliness, hoggishness, or some other one of
the score of faults she found in a child of ten years old, whom she put
down to work as steadily as a grown person.

A single month made a great change in his external appearance; such
a change as would have made him unfamiliar even to his mother's eye.
While under her care, his clothes, though poor, had always been whole
and clean--his skin well washed, and his hair combed smoothly. Now, the
color of his thin jacket and trowsers could scarcely have been told for
the dust and grease which had become imbedded in their texture. His skin
was begrimed until it was many shades darker, and his hair stood stiffly
about his head, in matted portions, looking as if a comb had not touched
it for weeks. One would hardly have imagined that so great a change could
have passed upon a boy in a few weeks as had passed over him. When he left
his mother's humble abode, there was something about him that instantly
attracted the eye of almost any one who looked at him attentively, and won
for him favorable impressions. His skin was pure and white, and his mild
blue eyes, with their expression of innocent confidence, looked every one
in the face openly. Now there was something repulsive to almost every one
about the dirty boy, who went moping about with soiled face and hands, a
cowed look, and shrinking gait. Scarcely any one seemed to feel a particle
of sympathy for him, either in or out of the house where he dwelt.

Time passed on, and New Year's day rapidly approached, that anxiously
longed-for time, to which Henry had never ceased to look forward since
he left his mother's presence. Every passing day seemed to render his
condition more and more uncomfortable. The air grew colder and colder,
and the snow lay all around to the depth of many inches. A suit of cloth
clothes had been "cooked up" for him out of an old coat and trowsers that
had long since been worn threadbare by Mr. Sharp. Thin though they were,
they yet afforded a most comfortable substitute for those their welcome
appearance had caused him to throw aside. But the pair of shoes he had
worn when he left Boston were still considered good enough, if thought
of at all, notwithstanding they gaped largely at the toes, and had been
worn so thin in the soles that scarcely the thickness of a knife-blade lay
between his feet and the snow-covered ground. In regard to sleeping, he
was not much better off. His bed was of straw, upon the floor, in a large,
unplastered garret, and but scantily supplied with covering. Here he would
creep away alone and in the dark every night, on being driven away to bed
from crouching beside the warm kitchen fire after his daily toil was done,
and get under the thin covering with all his clothes on. There he would
lie, all drawn up into a heap to keep warm, and think of his mother, and
long for New Year's day to come, until sleep would lock up his senses in
unconsciousness.

At last it was New Year's eve, but the poor child had heard no word about
going home. He could sleep but little through that night for thinking
about the promised return to his mother on the next day, and for the dread
he felt lest Mr. Sharp had forgotten, or would disregard his promise. The
bright morning of another new year at length arose, clear and piercingly
cold, and Henry crept early from his bed, and went down stairs to make the
fires as usual. When Mr. Sharp at length made his appearance, he looked
wishfully and inquiringly into his face, but no notice whatever was taken
of him, except to give him some order, in the usual short, rough tone in
which he always addressed him.

"Ain't I going home to see my mother to-day, sir?" was on his tongue, but
he feared to utter it.

After breakfast he watched every movement of Mr. Sharp, expecting each
moment to see him go out and get the chaise ready to take him to Boston.
But no such idea was in the mind of the thoughtless, unfeeling master.
Nine, ten, and eleven o'clock came and went, and the poor child's anxious
heart began to fail him. Several times he was on the point of recalling to
the mind of Mr. Sharp his promise to his mother that he should be sent
home at New Year's, but as often his timid heart caused him to shrink
back. At last dinner-time came, and yet nothing was said, nor were there
any indications that the boy was to go home. The meal passed, and then
Henry was directed to go on some errand about a mile away.

"But ain't I going home to-day, Mr. Sharp?" said he, with a sudden,
despairing resolution, looking up with tearful eyes, as he spoke.

"What's that?" eagerly asked Mrs. Sharp, coming forward. "What's that, ha?"

The frightened boy slunk back, and stood with his eyes upon the floor.

"Go where, did he say, Mr. Sharp?"

"Go to see his mammy, to be sure!" replied the hatter, in a half-sneering
tone of surprise.

"His mammy, indeed! And pray what put that into his head, I should like to
know?"

"Mr. Sharp told mother he would send me home to see her on New Year's
day," the child ventured to say, in explanation.

"Clear out! Off with you, Mr. Assurance!" exclaimed Sharp, in an angry
voice, at this, half raising his hand to strike the lad. "How dare you!"

Henry started back trembling, at once conscious that all hope of seeing
her he had so pined to meet for many long and weary days of suffering and
privation, was at an end. Slowly he left the house, shrinking in the cold
blast, and went on his errand through the hard frozen snow.

"Did any one ever hear such impudence!" ejaculated Mrs. Sharp, in
breathless surprise. "Sent home on New Year's day to his mammy! A pretty
how-do-you-do, upon my word! the dirty little ill-conditioned brat!"

"I believe, now I come to think of it," said Sharp, "that I did say
something of the kind to his mother, just to pacify her, though I had no
thought of doing it; and, indeed, I don't suppose she cares any great
deal about seeing him. She didn't look as if she could keep soul and body
together long."

"If she wanted to see him so dreadful bad, why didn't she keep him at home
with her, tied all the while to her apron-string?" said the unfeeling
woman.

"She would have had to work a little harder to have done that. No doubt
she was glad enough to get rid of the burden of supporting him."

"Well, all that I can say is, that any mother who is not willing to work
to take care of her children, don't deserve to see them."

"So say I," returned the husband.

"And as to Henry's going home, I wouldn't hear to any such thing. He'd not
be a bit too good to trump up any kind of stories about not being treated
well, so as to prevail upon her not to let him come back. I know just how
boys like him talk when they get a chance to run home. Even when they do
come back, they're never worth a cent afterwards."

"Oh, no! As to his going home, that is out of the question this winter,"
replied Sharp. "If his mother cares about seeing him, she'll find her way
out here."

With a sadder heart than ever did poor Henry grope his way up into the
cold garret that night, with but one thought and one image in his mind,
the thought of home and the image of his mother. He dreamed of her all
night. He was at home. Her tender voice was in his ear, and his head
rested on her bosom. She clothed him in warmer garments, and set him
beside her at the table, upon which was tempting food. But morning came
at last, and he was awakened from visions of delight to a more painful
consciousness of his miserable condition by the sharp, chiding voice of
his cruel mistress. Slowly, with stiffened limbs and a reluctant heart,
did he arise, and enter upon the repulsive and hard duties of another day.

As he had not been permitted to go home, his next consolatory thought was
that his mother would come out at once to see him. This hope he clung to
day after day, but he clung to it in vain. It mattered not that, every
time the shop door opened when he was in it, he turned with a quickened
pulse to see if it were not his mother, or that he would pause and listen,
when back in the house, to hear if the strange voice that came suddenly
from the shop, were not the voice of her he so longed to see. She came
not; nor was any word from her brought to him.

And thus passed the whole of the severe month of January, the long and
cold winter adding greatly to his other causes of suffering.

LETTERS LEFT AT THE PASTRY-COOK'S:

BEING THE CLANDESTINE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN KITTY CLOVER AT SCHOOL, AND
HER "DEAR, DEAR FRIEND" IN TOWN.

EDITED BY HORACE MAYHEW.


THE FOURTH LETTER LEFT.

(_Dated March 9th._)

SHOWING WHAT KITTY THOUGHT OF SOME MORE OF HER SCHOOLFELLOWS.

IN my last letter, I forgot to tell you about the two Miss Suetts, Emilia
and Julia. They are fat, and round, and heavy, like (Meggy says) a couple
of yeast dumplings. Their parents are in India, and they never go home.
No one cares much about that, however; for they are great _teazers_, and
the most dreadful _tell-tales_. But they are never without preserves and
pickles of some kind, and have such delicious pomegranates and guava
jelly sent to them, in such large blue jars, that, after all, I doubt
if any two girls would be more missed from the school than the two
Suetts--disagreeable things as they are. You should only taste their
tamarinds, Nell!

There is also Ada Steele, the poetess, who writes verses, some of which
have actually appeared in print (in the "Family Page," I think), and you
cannot imagine how conceited she is about it. I am told she knows every
line of poetry that ever was written. She is such a dreadful plague, that
I never go near her if I can avoid it. You cannot ask her what's the day
of the month, but she'll give you a hundred lines of poetry right off from
some poet or other. Meggy calls her "a tap of poetry," which once turned
on, will go on running till you stop it. Byron is her especial favorite,
and she always calls him "dear." His works are not allowed in the college;
but Ada Steele has got a copy of them, and she puts it under her pillow
every night.

But the girl I dislike most is Susan Carney. Fancy a tall, thin creature,
with hair the color of blotting-paper, and with eyes like an owl's, that
cannot look at you, and you have her standing before you. She is the
"_sneak_" of the school; and moves about like a cat. When we are talking
secrets, and turn round, there she is--pretending to look for something,
but in reality listening. Or, if a girl has comfortably got one of James's
delicious novels inside her grammar, and looks up to see that it is all
right and snug, there is Carney's cold, fishy eye sure to be fixed
sideways upon her. Meggy says her eye is so sharp, she's confident that,
like a needle's, _it would cut thread_. We cannot have a bit of fun but
Miss Carney is sure to spoil it. We cannot read or write a letter in
class without her knowing it. We cannot talk to the masters, or have a
comfortable bit of gossip about the filthy dinners and the lady principal,
without our being requested, before the day is half over, "to step to Mrs.
R.'s boudoir," after which you will see the girls coming back with red
eyes and burning cheeks.

The oddest thing is, no one is sure that it is Carney who tells, though
every one is convinced that she does. She manages it so cleverly that
she is never found out. We tease her as much as we dare, calling her
"policeman," "spy," "tell-tit," and everything we can think of; but it
takes no effect upon her. She turns a little pale, talks morality in a
whining tone, and leaves it to Mrs. Rodwell to redress her wrongs.

Another curious thing is the way in which she wheedles a secret out of
you. Though on your guard, she flatters and fawns, and coaxes and lectures
till you have parted with your secret long before you are aware of it.
You would imagine she was chloroform, so cleverly does she extract it,
without the smallest consciousness on your part. The fact is, _she crawls
over you_, Nelly; and as for talking, it is my firm belief she would talk
a letter out of a letter-box. She is exceedingly neat and clean, with not
a single hair out of bounds; and, somehow, her dresses do not rustle, nor
her shoes creak, as other persons' do. She is down upon you, like a shower
at the horticultural _fête_, before you have time to run for it. What with
her crawling, and her sleek appearance, and her gliding so noiselessly
about the room, she looks like a big lizard, or some slippery serpent,
that was advancing towards you; and I always feel inclined to scream, or
to put up my parasol, when she comes near me, to frighten her away.

Nor is she much a favorite with the remainder of the school. The little
girls bribe her with oranges and cakes, and lend her small sums of money,
to prevent her telling. But the big girls know it's no use, and waste
nothing upon her; they know well enough she will take the bribe one
minute, and go and _blab_ the next. The governesses are even afraid of
her, and begin talking of the weather whenever she approaches.

But what shocks me the most, Nelly, is that she is righteous. She moans
and groans, and turns up the whites (or the yellows, rather) of her
eyes, and is _so_ pious at church, and is always inveighing against
"the shameful wickedness" of the school. Then she reads hymns, and is
embroidering a _prie-dieu_ for her godpapa, who is something in the
church, and exceedingly rich; and she writes such insufferably long
sermons, twice the length of anybody else's; and after service she begs
to see Mrs. Rodwell, _pour confier son cœur_ as she calls it, but we all
know what that means, for as sure as plum-pudding on Sunday, some one is
sure to be punished that same afternoon! I only wish we could find her
out in anything. I really believe the entire school would rush up to the
lady principal, and tell of her. But Miss Carney is far too cautious to be
caught tripping! They tell me she even sleeps with her eyes open.

Let us turn from this hateful creature (I can't help hating her, Nelly) to
some more agreeable subject. I will not tire you with descriptions of Miss
Smiffel, the butcher's daughter, or Miss Embden, the baker's daughter,
except to tell you that they have a sad time of it, and are called rare
ugly names, because their papas happen to be butchers and bakers, just as
if they could help it. I need not tell you, either, about Lizzy Spree,
a little, merry, fidgety, laughing thing, with black eyes, who is the
romp--the "bad girl" of the school. She is always playing tricks, making
apple-pie beds, or sewing up the tops of our stockings, or hiding the
dancing-master's shoes, or tying the cat's tail to the parrot's leg, or
filling Miss Blight's bed with bread-crumbs and cockchafers, or breaking a
window, or tearing her dress every day. The consequence is, she is always
in punishment; but she cares no more for it than a duck cares for an
umbrella. She spends all her pocket-money on crackers and detonating balls
and valentines, and is always going to be expelled; only Mrs. Rodwell
relents, and gives her "one chance more." The maid fell down stairs with
the soup-tureen yesterday, from the fact of her strewing the kitchen-steps
with marbles and orange-peel. It was too bad. We had to go without soup in
consequence.

But, Nelly, you would quite love little Jessie Joy; she is the wee'st
little thing you ever saw. You might hang her to your _châtelaine_. You
would declare that she was not more than ten, and yet she was sixteen last
birthday. She has a rosy round face, and little flaxen curls, exactly like
a pretty doll, if you could only keep her still for a moment to look at
her. She plays about the room like the sun on a looking-glass, and her
whole body seems to quiver with light. I defy you to catch her, unless,
perhaps, it was in the dark. We call her "pet" and "tiny."

I don't know how it is Jessie cannot be taught; and yet she is far from
being an idiot, for the little thing understands; nor is she stupid, for
she is quick enough to outwit us all. Still, they have never been able
to teach her anything. Her eyes (I don't know what color they are) fly
away like butterflies directly you attempt to catch them, and settle on
all places but on her book. We think she can read, but no one is sure of
it. If told to learn, she pouts her lips like cherries, until you feel
inclined to bite them; and her little head swings to and fro, Nelly, like
the bells on a fuchsia when set a dancing by the wind. The lady principal
cannot scold her. The utmost she can do is to call her to her in an angry
tone, when she takes up her little head in her two hands as if it were
a bowl of milk, and kisses her gently on the forehead. This is all her
punishment; and the little culprit runs back into her place as quick as a
rabbit.

But if she can't read, or spell, or learn, you should only hear her sing,
Nell! It is like a wild bird. She warbles every air she hears. Music
seems to gush from her like water from a fountain. Once she was caught
playing, and they say it sounded like the rejoicing of good spirits; but
she cried when they wanted her to do it again, and has never touched the
instrument since. She dances more like a fairy than a human being. And
yet when Monsieur Viaulon (the French dancing-master) attempted to teach
her the polka, she ran away and hid herself behind the great globe in the
music-room. The truth is, her dancing has nothing of the ball-room in it.
She flits about so restlessly, it makes your eyes wink to look at her. Her
feet never seem happy on the ground, and I always have a curious fear when
the window is opened that Jessie will fly out of it.

The girls are rather frightened at her restless ways and her strange
beauty, which seem to belong more to the air than to the earth. They
declare that she is a fairy changeling; and that the tale which is told of
her father being shot in a duel, and of her mother dying when Jessie was
born, is all a story. Jessie rarely goes home. The only person who comes
to see her is an aged aunt, with a face all over lines, like a railway
map. She brings her plenty of toys and plenty of sweeties; but Jessie,
apparently, does not care the least about her. The only person her flighty
disposition stops in its giddy career to alight upon is Amy Darling. She
listens to no one else without impatience--she will play with no one else,
except it is a young kitten that belongs to the cook--she will obey no one
else. But then I believe, if Amy spoke to the lightning, that she would
stop it.

I am so tired of scribbling, dear Nelly, that I can't write any more
to-day, though I could fill a whole band-box with particulars about this
place. So no more at present from your dear affectionate.

    KITTY.

SOME THOUGHTS ON TRAINING FEMALE TEACHERS.

BY MISS M. S. G.


IN a former communication, we sought to awaken the more lively and
_practising_ interest of ladies generally (especially those possessed
of large means and influence), in the subject of teacher-training to an
extent and thoroughness of method which have hitherto been scarcely deemed
requisite, especially in those portions of the country where education
has been conducted too much, if we may say so, at _hap-hazard_. Such of
our readers as have traversed various sections of our wide-spread land
will realize what we mean, as they recall juvenile groups, collected
or _bustled_ together, because something must be done with them, to be
coaxed, awed, or driven by a leader who occupied the post as a _pis
aller_, or as a mere half-way house to some less wearisome or more
lucrative avocation. We are not fearful here of wounding the self-love
or better feelings of any truly estimable or conscientious teacher,
for such we have ever found the most prompt to welcome improvement,
the most open to suggestions of amendment. But perceiving, as we do,
throughout the community, marked signs of a willingness, a desire to
assign to instructors a more elevated position, a post of honor among the
benefactors of the race, and knowing, by experience, the readiness of many
to meet the requisite claims of expenditure, it is to teachers themselves,
to young teachers especially, and to those aspiring to that high and
responsible office, that we would now offer a few earnest, and we trust
heart-stirring questions and remarks.

We would ask on whom and on what must _mainly_ rest the position they are
to hold, the _character_ of the work to be effected? Surely, in themselves
and in the disinterested and docile spirit with which it is entered on
and pursued. Short of high aims and pure motives, no course can leave its
valuable impress, and it is an acknowledged, even if too little credited,
maxim, that they who best learn to obey and submit to lawful rule, best
know how to govern. Let us therefore be permitted to persuade the young
and high-spirited to remember that _their time will come_ to take the
lead, and that no premature assumption of authority or airs of control
will avail for half the benefit to be derived from a teachable spirit,
and quiet observing and waiting for opportunity. We know full well and
practically that this simple method is capable of eliciting the most
harmonious and beautiful results, and that between teachers of experience
and those seeking preparation for the work, a friendship will grow of a
character the most extended and the most varied in its points of interest.
We will not pause to enlarge on the sad contrast to this state of things,
its multiform evils--for we do not like looking on the dark side of
subjects which should bring out every latent grace and virtue of the soul.
Moreover, we are fully persuaded of better things, so far at least as
intention and desire are concerned, yet a friendly hand may offer some
warning hints of evils which are wont to creep in and mar the benefit and
beauty of fulfilment.

A trite motto tells us that "manners make the man!" It is, at least, by
all conceded that they are the outward garb and indication of that which
is within, and that to a degree of which the actor is often unaware and
unconscious. Can the young teacher then deem unimportant any measure of
care in deportment, or regard as too severe a self-sacrifice the gentle
and habitual control of those ebullitions of spirits, those out-of-place
familiarities which we have oftentimes seen sweeping away the outguards
of reverence by action, word, or look? If these are in an isolated
individual annoying or unseemly, how great are their effect and potency
when a sympathetic influence pervades a number met for the same purpose,
and that avowedly one of the highest improvement and culture! A little
true _reflection_ on this point would, we are assured, convert many a
well-meaning, but unpolished, and therefore ill-prepared young woman into
the well-mannered lady, the true helper of her presiding teacher, and, in
time, the consistently dignified instructress of others.

Again, we know that _simplicity_ is ever the expression of the highest
truth, of elegance, and of purity. We need not rake up classical
authority, or quote the poets, to prove what makes its own way to every
unsophisticated mind and heart. But would indeed that the "daughters of
the land" might consider this, and reflect on St. Paul's caution, "Not
the outward adorning of plaiting the hair, or of wearing of gold, or of
putting on of apparel," ere they present themselves as examples to the
young, so especially, on _this_ point, prone to imitation and emulation.
Far higher, we feel assured, would they then rise in the _true_ esteem of
their juniors, far more secure would they be of reaching and maintaining
that position to which _every_ teacher should aspire, that of feeling that
in a _real_ superiority none has the claim or the power to surpass them.

Our time and space are limited, and we do not desire to crowd on our
readers too much of our own practical experience, and "notes taken from
life by the way." If welcomed, however, with the sincere good-will with
which they are offered, other "thoughts" may yet find utterance, and, we
would fondly trust, find their counterpart in the efficient action of many

DON'T OVERTASK THE YOUNG BRAIN.

THE minds of children ought to be little, if at all, tasked, till the
brain's development is nearly completed, or until the age of six or seven
years. And will those years be wasted? or will the future man be more
likely to be deficient in mental power and capability, than one who is
differently treated? Those years will not be wasted. The great book of
nature is open to the infant's and the child's prying investigation;
and from nature's page may be learned more useful information than is
contained in all the children's books that have ever been published. But
even supposing those years to have been absolutely lost, which is anything
but the case, will the child be eventually a loser thereby? We contend,
with our author, that he will not. Task the mind during the earlier years,
and you not only expose the child to a greater risk of a disordered
brain--not only, it may be, lay the foundation for a morbid excitability
of brain, that may one day end in insanity--but you debilitate its bodily
powers, and by so doing, to all intents and purposes, the mind will
eventually be a loser in its powers and capabilities.--_Dr. Robertson._




THE SOUVENIR; OR, THE ARRIVAL OF THE "LADY'S BOOK."

A SKETCH OF SOUTHERN LIFE.

BY PAULINE FORSYTH.

(_See Plate._)

    "You may train the eagle
      To stoop to your fist,
    Or you may inveigle
      The Phœnix of the East;
    The lioness, you may move her
      To give up her prey;
    But you'll ne'er stop a lover,
      He will find out the way."--_Old Song._


A SOUTHERN plantation lying, as so many of them do, at some distance from
any town or village, presents a phase of life peculiar to itself, and
very singular to one unaccustomed to it from childhood. It has not the
loneliness of isolation, for each planter's house is in its way a sort
of a palace, the residence of the superior authority, while at a little
distance are clustered together the cabins of his retainers, sometimes
in such numbers as to form almost a little village of their own. Yet the
members of the family are often separated for weeks or months from all
congenial companionship, excepting what they can find in each other; for,
besides the distance, the state of the roads is often an insuperable
obstacle to all intercourse with their far-off neighbors. Eminently social
as Southerners usually are, this is no slight drawback to their enjoyment,
and the arrival of the post is looked forward to as the one great weekly
event to relieve the monotony of "the leaden-footed hours."

Bessie Egerton was in this respect more fortunate than many of her
companions, her father's plantation being but about five miles from the
village of Oxford, in South Carolina. This was only a pleasant ride when
the roads were good; but there were weeks during the winter and early
spring when even Bessie Egerton, general belle and favorite as she was
throughout the surrounding country, had nothing but the mails to remind
her that there were other interests and more stirring events in the world
than those of which her home was the centre.

Mr. Egerton was not one of those wealthy planters whose income rivals
that of the merchant princes of the North, and would be a pretty fortune
for a person of moderate wants; but he was in comfortable circumstances,
and Bessie's home was a very pleasant one. The house stood on a gentle
slope, and with its wide verandas covered with roses, jessamine, and honey
suckles, and overhung by live-oak trees, from whose gnarled branches
hung drooping long fringes of the gray moss, giving them the venerable
appearance of age, it suggested ideas of coolness and shade, the peculiar
comforts of that part of the country.

It was in the latter part of February; the early spring was already coming
on with the laggard steps of one sure of its dominion, and therefore in
no haste to assert it. The rose-bushes, that had but a few weeks before
shaken off their summer's burden of leaves and flowers, gave tokens that
they were about to take it up once more, and the yellow jessamine in the
woods, with those many beautiful, but as yet unnamed vines and flowers
that adorn the swamps and marshes of the South, had already begun to
awaken from their winter's slumber.

Bessie had been busy all the morning. Her mother was a confirmed invalid,
and upon the eldest daughter of the house were devolved all the active
duties that belong to the mistress of a plantation--much heavier and more
arduous than those of a Northern housekeeper, requiring the exercise of
more thought and discretion. After breakfast, with her basket of keys,
that invariable accompaniment of a Southern housekeeper, she went to the
store-room to give out the dinner for the family. There, after having
measured out the flour and spices, and counted the eggs, and portioned off
the vegetables required, she stood to see that everything was replaced
in its proper order. Her next visit was to the smoke-house for the
meat, and there she was often required to superintend the distribution
of certain portions of it, both to the house and field-servants on her
father's place. Then giving a scrutinizing glance at the poultry-yard
as she passed, she sought the spring-house, which was a dairy also, and
remained there for an hour overlooking the operations of the dairy-woman.
From thence she bent her steps to the negro-quarter, where there were
two or three sick servants, of whose condition her mother wished to
have a particular account. To obtain an idea of their ailments and their
needs was the work of no little time, for to be sparing of words is not
a characteristic of either the ignorant or the suffering. She ended her
duties here by a visit to her nurse, now a bedridden old woman, and, after
talking with her for a little while, and reading to her, as was Bessie's
daily practice, she returned to what was called, _par excellence_, "the
house."

When she entered her mother's room to give a detailed account of all that
she had done, she was greeted with--

"Bessie, dear, I want you to cut out directly a shirt and a pair of
trowsers for Peter. He has just been in to say that his old ones are not
fit to wear to church, and, if he don't have some new ones, he cannot
go next Sunday; and, as it is communion-day, I do not like to have him
compelled to stay away by any neglect of mine."

"But he ought to have given us a little more time, I think," said Bessie.
"To-day is Friday."

"Yes, dear; but Dinah can make the shirt, and you can have Elsie,
your little maid, to help you with the trowsers. She is quite a neat
seamstress."

"But I told Elsie to sew on my new dress to-day. I intended to wear it
next Sunday."

"You have plenty of old ones that you can wear, my dear. Peter must be
attended to first in this case, I think."

Bessie was so accustomed to be the hands to do the bidding of her mother's
thoughtful and considerate head and heart, that she made no farther
objection to complying with Mrs. Egerton's suggestion. Since she was
fifteen, she had been in the habit of cutting out, under her mother's
supervision, not only nearly all her own clothing, including her dresses,
that very abstruse and difficult portion of female attire, but also the
clothing for all the servants, men, women, and children, on her father's
place; so that the particular portion of the work assigned her was quickly
and skilfully performed. But, pressed for time as they were, she had also
to assist in the sewing, and she was busily employed with her needle,
preparing for Peter his Sunday habiliments, when the noise of a carriage
driving up to the door attracted her attention.

"It is Nannie and Virginia Lanning," said Bessie to her mother, after a
glance from the window, and she ran to welcome her guests.

"Now, I hope you have come to stay with me two or three days," said
Bessie, after the first greetings were over, with the hospitable warmth
common to the class to which she belonged; an invitation to pass the
night at their houses being usually the shortest time to which a Southern
planter restricts his invitations, equivalent to the "Stay and take tea
with us," of the Northerners.

"Yes," replied Nannie, "we have come to pass Sunday with you, and the idea
of going to church once more is quite a treat; it is three months since
we have been off our place. The roads have been so bad, and Prince got
lame, and pa, who thinks almost as much of his horses as he does of us,
would neither sell him and buy another, nor allow him to be used till he
was quite well; so that we have really been prisoners. It is a great favor
that he allowed us to drive with him so far, but we promised to come very
slowly. We have been nearly six hours coming these ten or eleven miles."

"Don't you often feel very lonely?" asked Bessie.

"Yes, indeed. Sometimes for two or three weeks we do not see a human being
out of our own family; and it comes very hard at first, after we have
been travelling about all summer; but it is astonishing how soon we get
accustomed to it. We have occasional visitors, though, that break in on
the monotony, if they do nothing else. You know we have no tavern within
twelve or fifteen miles of us, and, as father has the largest house in the
neighborhood, travellers are often directed there to pass the night, and
sometimes they prove to be very agreeable people."

"Yes," said Virginia, "there was a lawyer from Philadelphia travelling
through the country on business, that Nannie declares she fell in love
with; and then there was a Yankee quack doctor that stayed with us
nearly a week, and amused us very much. He took our house for a tavern,
and ordered the servants about, and made himself quite at home. He told
father that he thought that he had rather a tumble-down sort of a place,
but, if he would just spry up a little and go to work, he might fix up
considerable."

"And," continued Nannie, "when he was going away, he pulled out an old
pocket-book and said, 'Wall, Squire, what's the damage?' And when pa told
him, 'Nothing, that it was a private house, but that he was very happy to
afford travellers the shelter they could procure nowhere else,' the man
looked quite confounded. 'Wall, really,' said he, 'ef I ain't beat out. I
hadn't the least idea that this wasn't a public house; but I thought you
had a dreadful shiftless way of doin' business. Why, there was enough
on your table at dinner to last our folks to hum for a hull week. But, I
must say, you've treated me fust rate; and, of you ever get up as far as
old Connecticut, and will come to Peterboro', just ask for Isa Jeffries,
and I will do as much for you.' And he went to see if his horse was ready;
but he soon came back with a bottle in his hand. 'Here, Squire,' said he,
'that youngest darter of your'n has a very peaked sort of look. Ef she
will take some of my Electron here, it will do her a sight of good.' And
so he left the bottle for Virginia. Poor Virginia! It was quite a shock to
her to hear herself called peaked-looking, especially since Mr. Chapman
has persuaded her that she was sylph-like."

"It only shows with what different eyes different people look on the same
thing," said Virginia, with philosophic composure. "And now let us go to
your mother."

"You seem to be very busy, Bessie," said Nannie, after they were seated in
Mrs. Egerton's room. "What are you doing?"

"Making some clothes for Peter, our waiter. He is something of a dandy,
and made the discovery this morning that he had nothing fit to wear to
church next Sunday, so we have been a little hurried about it."

"Oh, we can help you after dinner; and, together, we can soon finish
them," said Virginia.

At dinner, Bessie asked her father if he could not send Peter to the
post-office that afternoon.

"Why, Bessie," said her father, "I sent him for you yesterday, and
I cannot conveniently spare him to go every day. You seem to have a
post-office mania lately, coming on at regular intervals."

"Yes, father," said Agnes, Bessie's younger sister; "ever since the
'Lady's Book' began to come so mysteriously, Bessie is never easy till she
gets it; and I want it quite as much. Do, please, send for it."

Of course, Mr. Egerton could not resist his children's entreaties, and
Bessie had the satisfaction of seeing Peter set out for Oxford soon after
dinner.

Towards the close of the afternoon, Bessie proposed that the work now
nearly completed should be left to Elsie to finish, while they went out
to enjoy the fresh, soft air, full of the sunshine and life of the early
spring.

"Don't you think the other side of the house is less sunny?" suggested
Nannie, as Bessie seated herself on the green bank by the house, with
Agnes standing at her side.

"This is much pleasanter, I think, and the sun will soon be away. But
take my parasol, dear; I have a bonnet, and do not need it."

"Oh no, thank you; I am going to finish this story, and could not trouble
myself to hold it. Virginia and I pride ourselves on complexions that
neither sun nor wind can affect."

And, in truth, their clear, dark, colorless, yet healthful complexions
gave to their features the firm, unimpressible look of finely polished
marble.

"I will tell you," said Agnes, "why sister always chooses this seat. We
can see Peter from here long before he reaches the gate."

"Then," said Nannie, "I quite agree with her in thinking it decidedly the
pleasantest. I am as impatient as she can be to see the 'Book;' but I
candidly confess that the fashions are its chief attraction to me. It is a
great thing to know exactly how other people dress, so as to be sure, when
you come out of your winter's shell, that you are not making a fright of
yourself."

"Pa and I like the stories," said Agnes.

"So do I," said Virginia.

"But ma likes the serious part of it," continued Agnes, "and Bessie the
poetry, especially if it is marked. I see her crying over it sometimes."

"Oh, Agnes!" said Bessie, while her face flushed suddenly.

"I would like to know what all those blushes mean," said Nannie; "whenever
we mention the 'Lady's Book,' I see Bessie's cheeks growing red. What can
be the association of ideas that produces such a remarkable effect?"

"You know Wallace Cuthbert?" said Agnes.

"Agnes, hush; you do not know anything about it," interrupted Bessie.

"Yes, dear, I know Wallace Cuthbert. Go on," said Nannie, encouragingly.

"Do, just let me tell this," said Agnes, too eager to impart what she
considered her wonderfully acute conjecture to show her usual deference
to her elder sister. "You know, Wallace Cuthbert asked pa if he might not
write occasionally to Bessie when he went away, and pa would not consent
to it. But ever since he first went to Philadelphia the 'Lady's Book' has
been coming regularly, and I have no doubt he sends it, and marks the
poetry, too."

"Now, Agnes, I hope you have finished your revelations," said Bessie, a
little impatiently. "Of course," continued she, turning to Nannie, "this
is a mere conjecture of Agnes's, and a very childish one."

"On the contrary, I think it a very shrewd one; it is putting cause and
effect together in a wise and discreet way that is entirely satisfactory
to me. For one, I feel myself under great obligations to Wallace Cuthbert,
and intend to tell him, when I see him, that he could not have chosen a
more judicious means if he wished 'to keep his memory green,' and connect
pleasant associations with thoughts of himself. Pa has promised me that,
when I am eighteen, I may take the 'Lady's Book' for myself, and I am
quite impatient for my next birthday to come."

"See, there is Peter!" said Virginia, who had, with her usual quiet
sagacity, seated herself so that she could catch the first glimpse of him.
"He seems to be waving something."

"Oh, he has brought it!" said Agnes, springing up joyfully. "I am so glad!
I was afraid it would not come before Monday, because, when you wait and
watch so for anything, you are almost sure to be disappointed."

"Peter seems to understand what we are expecting, and to be as delighted
as any of us," said Nannie.

"Oh, yes," replied Agnes; "he knows how glad we are to get it; besides,
he feels sure that it comes from Wallace Cuthbert, and he has always been
very fond of him. He said to me one day, after the 'Book' first began to
come regularly, and when we were all wondering about it, I am certain
sure, Miss Agnes, Mas'r Wallace has a finger in dat pie.' That gave me
my first suspicions about Mr. Cuthbert; and I asked pa about it, and he
said, 'Very likely.' Peter says, too, that if 'Miss Bessie will only marry
Mas'r Wallace, and take him for her head waiter, his earthly hopes will be
suspended.'"

"Agnes, how can you repeat such nonsense?" said Bessie, in a state of
desperate confusion.

"I like to hear little people talk," said Nannie; "a great deal of useful
information can be obtained from them. You seem to have a wonderful
faculty, Agnes, for putting this and that together; but I have a little
sister at home that is almost equal to you."

"Give it to me, Peter," said Virginia, springing forward to take the
offered prize; "the others seem to be absorbed in such an interesting
discussion that they will not care about it."

But, notwithstanding this assertion, the cover was no sooner torn off,
which Bessie took an opportunity, when unobserved, to slip into her
pocket, than the four heads were crowded together over the engravings and
fashion plate with an eagerness and delight that it would be difficult to
express. For the first few minutes they all talked at once, exclaiming,
"Isn't this pretty?" "Isn't it lovely?" "I wonder what it means!" "Let's
read the story about it."

"Do look, what an odd fashion! It is pretty, though. I mean to make my new
dress so."

"See here, girls," said Mr. Egerton, leaning over the veranda, "if you go
on in that way I shall have to make the same rule the Scotch laird did
with his thirteen daughters--that not more than seven of them should speak
at a time. What has caused this outburst of enthusiasm?"

"The 'Lady's Book,' pa," said Bessie. "Look at that picture; isn't it
beautiful?"

"It is, indeed," replied he, taking the "Book." "How much they have
improved lately in the art of engravings! Why, when I was a boy, a picture
like that would have been considered wonderfully fine, and would have
been carefully laid away and preserved as a rare treasure; and now they
are flying about on the wings of the post-office department into the most
distant parts and by-places of the country. They must be of no small
advantage in cultivating the taste of the community, coming as they do to
many persons who see but few other books during the year. Here, Bessie,
you had better take the 'Book' to your mother; she is always pleased to
see it, and this evening we will have a family reading party."

Excusing herself to her companions, Bessie hastened to comply with her
father's suggestion, but returned with the welcome arrival after a few
minutes, when an animated discussion was held over the fashion-plates
and the descriptions of them. The conversation was serious and earnest.
No assembly of divines ever debated a knotty point in theology with more
intent gravity than these young girls wasted over the questions as to
whether bodices, which were evidently going out, were not in the main
superior to round waists, which were coming in; whether basques were
likely to be a permanent fashion, or a mere fleeting freak of fancy, was
also warmly discussed; and the question of trailing skirts, or those
just long enough to touch the ground, might have caused a schism, if
Bessie, with great presence of mind, had not changed the conversation to
the arrangement of the hair. Here all differences were swept away by the
unanimous agreement that _bandeaux_ of curls, _à la_ Jenny Lind, was a
much prettier and easier way of dressing the head than any other.

A summons to tea interrupted all farther discussion. After tea, the
whole family assembled, as was their custom, in Mrs. Egerton's room. Mr.
Egerton, without his hat, which many Southerners seem to think as useful
in the house as out of it, was seated in the large arm-chair by the side
of a blazing fire, which the chilliness of the evenings still rendered
necessary; Nannie heaped up the cushions on the lounge, a home-made,
chintz-covered affair, and made herself perfectly comfortable; the other
two girls, constituting themselves the readers for the rest, seated
themselves by the centre-table; while Agnes sometimes sat on the bed by
her mother, and sometimes hung over the reader, to make sure with her own
eyes that they were scrupulously giving each word--skipping was, in her
eyes, a most unjustifiable and unpardonable act.

"There is still enough to occupy us to-morrow evening," said Bessie, as
she closed the "Book;" "but it is time now for mother to go to sleep."

As she bent over to kiss her mother for good-night, Mrs. Egerton
whispered--

"That was a very cunning plan Wallace hit upon, dear, to evade your
father's prohibition about letters. He gives us all so much pleasure that
we do not think of objecting to it. Don't you think he must be a very
designing sort of a man?"

"We don't know at all that it is Wallace," said Bessie, stoutly.

"We shall see what we shall see. Has he marked anything?"

"There are a few foolish verses marked; but I do not know who did it,"
replied Bessie.

"Well, leave the 'Book' with me; I would like to read them."

That was very hard. Bessie had only had time to glance hastily over some
lines signed W. C., and speaking in woful strains of the pangs of absence
and hope deferred, but breathing the most devoted constancy and love.
These verses which, in her reckless confusion, she had stigmatized as
foolish, she was longing to read over and over in the silence of her own
room. But she would not, for the whole of Carolina, have expressed her
wish. She quietly laid the "Book" on her mother's bed, placed the candles
near her, and retired with her companions.

"Did you hear, my dear," said Mrs. Egerton to her husband, when they were
left alone, "what Mr. Littleton, who has just returned from Philadelphia,
says of Wallace Cuthbert--about the high estimation in which the
professors of the university hold him? One of them told Mr. Littleton that
he regarded Mr. Cuthbert as one of their most promising students, and that
he bid fair to become one of the first physicians in the country."

"No, I have not heard it before; but I always had a good opinion of
him. I refused to allow him to write to Bessie when he went away, three
years ago, because they were both too young, I thought, to entangle
themselves in any way. Bessie was hardly sixteen, and he but four or five
years older. And he had not only his profession to acquire, but also to
establish himself; for he has little else than his own talents to depend
upon. Besides, I did not think Bessie cared much about him; she did not
appear to."

"I think she always preferred him; but her preference was not a very
decided one when he went away," said Mrs. Egerton. "Indeed, she was too
young to know herself exactly whether she loved him or not; but it has
happened that in each one of these monthly souvenirs that Mr. Cuthbert
has been sending, there has been some pathetic story or touching little
poem, by marking which he has contrived to indicate his own feelings, and
not only preserve, but deepen Bessie's interest in him. I can perceive, I
think, that her liking for him has grown stronger almost day by day. It is
very clear that she cares for no one else. Here were George Musgrave and
Robert Linn, two of the richest and finest young men about, whom Bessie
dismissed without a moment's hesitation."

"Well," said Mr. Egerton, "I am perfectly willing to trust Bessie to make
her own choice, now that she is old enough to judge for herself. We will
leave the matter to time to settle."

Time justified Mrs. Egerton's previsions. Wallace Cuthbert did not
disappoint the high expectations that had been formed of him, and was soon
able to claim Bessie's hand as a reward for his assiduity and devotion to
his profession.

"I think you may thank the 'Lady's Book' for Bessie's constancy," said
Mrs. Egerton one day to Mr. Cuthbert. "If it had not been for some such
suggestive memorial, I am afraid she would hardly have resisted all the
attacks made upon her."

"Very likely," said Mr. Cuthbert, smiling. But, though his words
expressed such proper humility, in his inmost heart, with that generous
self-appreciation so unusual perhaps in his modest sex, he attributed
the love and the patient waiting of Bessie Egerton entirely to his own
peculiar merits.

Peter's "earthly hopes _were_ suspended."




THE WILD FLOWERS OF EARLY SPRING-TIME.

    "There is at times a solemn gloom
    Ere yet the lovely Spring assume
    Sole empire, with the lingering cold
    Content divided sway to hold;
    A sort of interreign, which throws
    On all around its dull repose;
    Dull, not unpleasing; when the rest
    Nor snow, nor rains, nor winds molest;
    Nor aught by listening ear is heard
    Save first-fruit notes of vernal bird,
    Alone, or with responsive call,
    Or sound of twinklings waterfall;
    Yet is no radiant brightness seen
    To pierce the cloud's opposing screen,
    Or hazy vapor to illume
    The thickness of that solemn gloom."
                                  MANT.


THOSE accustomed to the gay and busy life of a city know little of the
_ennui_ that _generally_ attends a rural life. Those who live in the bosom
of nature, as it were--in the very midst of God's beautiful works--ought
not to feel wearisome; and they would not if their eyes were open to the
interesting phenomena that continually go on around them. Every season of
the year, every day, nay every hour, brings about some instructive change
on the face of Nature; and there is no more interesting and improving
pursuit than the observation of natural phenomena. To watch the opening
of the buds, the leafing of the trees, the blooming of the flowers, the
ripening of the fruit, and the decay and death which autumn brings, is
of itself an interesting occupation; but when we connect these various
events with their proximate causes, and endeavor to trace those general
laws by whose operation they are regulated, then the study becomes a truly
philosophical as well as a pleasant one. We may also gather spiritual
wisdom from such contemplations. Our beloved Saviour sought to illustrate
his teachings by a reference to the phenomena of plants; we are directed
to "Consider the lilies how they grow; they toil not, neither do they
spin; yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
like one of these." Every reader of this page may have "considered" the
lilies and admired the beauty of their various parts; but in the passage
which has been quoted there is, perhaps, a deeper meaning than many have
guessed at. Consider the lilies _how they grow;_ examine their structure,
and their beautiful mode of development; see how the fair form of this
beauteous flower rises, "like a resurrection from the dead," out of its
scaly, withered-like bulbous root, perfects its fruit, and then decays.
To know _how_ the lily _grows_ is to know the most important principles
of vegetable physiology. It is a gratifying fact that the physical
sciences are now becoming important branches of general education, and no
department is more popular than botany. It is a science peculiarly adapted
for ladies; the objects whose purpose it is to investigate are beautiful,
and esteemed by every one--a striking contrast to the forbidding
directions and dirty experiments which are necessary in the prosecution of
many other departments of natural science; even Entomology--the study of
insects--requires the bottling of poor beetles in spirituous solutions,
the pinning of innocent moths and gay butterflies, and other cruel
operations, at which every kind-hearted woman ought to shudder.

In pursuing botanical investigations, even very slightly, it is necessary
to form a _herbarium_, or collection of dried specimens of plants. In
these collections much taste may be displayed in the arrangement, as
well as in the careful drying of the specimens; and the writer of these
observations--a public teacher of botany to extensive classes of both
ladies and gentlemen--can testify to the fact that the herbaria formed
by ladies are, as a general rule, pre-eminent for neatness and artistic
beauty in the arrangement of the specimens. It is difficult, however,
for ladies who have not the benefit of a teacher, nor friends devoted to
botanical pursuits, to get an acquaintance with the method of preserving
plants properly; and it is therefore deemed advisable to offer a few
observations on this subject on the present occasion, before going on to
consider the characteristics of the Spring Flora.

The process of preparing botanical specimens may be shortly described to
be, the pressure of plants between sheets of soft absorbent paper for the
purpose of extracting their moisture without destroying their beauty, and
thus enabling them to be kept for an indefinite period in an arranged
form, for future reference and study. When well dried, plants may be kept
for hundreds of years; they are almost as indestructible as books, if
properly cared for.

German botanists excel in the beauty, and well-preserved specific
characters, of their specimens; as is well evidenced by the beautiful
specimens which they send to this country. One reason of their success
is no doubt to be attributed to the very soft paper (made from woollen
rags) which they use in the process; but it is no doubt due, in a larger
measure, to the great care which they take, and the time and patience
which they bestow upon their specimens.

Plants ought, in all cases where practicable, to be gathered when _dry_;
or, if moist with rain or dew when gathered, they ought to be exposed to
the atmosphere of a dry room for an hour or two previous to being put into
papers. For the conveyance of specimens a tin box, called a _vasculum_,
is used, which prevents the plants withering during a long journey, and
otherwise protects them. Some of our readers may not think the japanned
tin vasculum a very elegant accoutrement, but it is quite usual for ladies
to carry such along the streets of Modern Athens, where, through the
labors of Professor Balfour and others, botany has, of late years, become
of high repute as a feminine accomplishment.

In proceeding to dry the plants, procure a quantity of soft
blotting-paper. Four or five sheets are to be laid down on the table (each
folded within the other, as in a ream), and on the uppermost one the
specimen is to be laid. Spread it out carefully, separating the branches
and leaves so that they do not overlap; and after this is done, a slip
of paper or "label" put beside the specimen, indicating its botanical
name, the locality where collected, and the date when; then another four
or five sheets, folded as before, are to be laid over the plant. On the
surface of this latter layer of paper, another specimen or specimens may
be spread--an additional layer of four or five sheets being placed over
them--and so on until all the specimens collected are spread out. A board
of the same size as the paper is to be placed above the uppermost sheet,
and on the top of that a heavy weight, fifty or sixty pounds. A bundle
of large volumes will serve the purpose of a weight, if no better is at
hand. Some recommend a screw-press for pressing the plants, instead of a
weight; but presses of all kinds are objectionable, as the shrinking of
the plants renders the pressure unequal from the want of elasticity, which
is so easily attained by means of an ordinary weight. After the specimens
have been allowed to stand in this manner twenty-four hours or so, they
should be taken carefully out; such leaves as are disarranged should be
spread out properly, and the whole put into _dry_ paper, in the same way
as in the previous operation. The moist paper from which they are taken
should be spread before the fire to dry; it will be ready for use another
time. The plants are to be supplied with dry paper, in this manner, once
every twenty-four hours, until they have become quite dry, when they may
be taken out and put apart in single sheets of gray paper.

The operation of _drying_ the specimens has been here described, but that
of _mounting_ them on _white_ paper is equally important. Gum Arabic is
generally used for this purpose, but it is very bad; does not adhere
sufficiently, and thus allows the specimens to spring off from the sheets.
Fine glue, prepared in a very thin state, is the best material for fixing
the plants. The melted glue should, when very hot, be spread over the
specimen carefully with a brush, a sheet of dirty absorbent paper lying
beneath the specimen to prevent the glue soiling anything, and then the
specimen is to be put down upon the sheet of white paper previously laid
out for its reception. A towel is then taken to press the different
branches or leaves gently down upon the surface of the paper. After this
is done, a few sheets of drying paper are to be laid over the specimen,
and on the top of this another sheet of white paper for the reception of
another glued specimen, and so on until all are completed. A board is then
to be placed over the whole, and a weight, in order to press all parts of
the plants equally to the sheets of paper, until they are made firm by
the drying of the glue. After the specimens have stood in this manner a
few hours, they are to be taken out, their names, localities, and dates
written at the bottom of the sheet, and the whole arranged in such manner
as the possessor may think proper. Any refractory stems or branches that
have sprung up from the paper in spite of the glue, may be fastened down
by slips of gummed paper. The marginal portion of postage-stamp sheets
supplies these to those who can obtain them in sufficient quantity.

The plants of each genus are to be put together inside of a double sheet
of paper, with their _generic_ name written at the bottom of the sheet
upon the outside at the left hand corner; for instance, the pansy, the
sweet violet, the dog violet, the yellow mountain violet, &c., are all to
be put inside of one double sheet, the generic name "VIOLA" being written
upon the corner of it. This is to facilitate references.

We now proceed to point out what spring flowers are likely to reward the
exertions of those who go in search of them among the woods and fields.
And first of all the primrose and the cowslip demand attention as general
favorites. The wild plant, with its modest flower of pale yellow hue
(which has given rise to the name of a tint known as primrose yellow), is
probably familiar to every one, but it may not be so well known that the
gay polyanthus of our florists, and the rich double-flowered primroses
of every hue which decorate our gardens, all owe their existence to
the wild plant as their original stock. The cowslip, although local in
its geographical distribution, is abundant in many localities, and is
associated right pleasantly with cowslip wine. Beneath the hedges in
early spring-time there is a pretty little plant which seldom catches the
eye of the passer-by; it is aptly styled the "gloryless," for its little
flowers are of greenish-yellow hue, and so small as to be inconspicuous
to any one save the botanical explorer. When examined, however, it is an
object of great, though simple beauty. It sends up a delicate stem, which
bears a little rosette of divided leaves, and from amidst this rises the
flower-stalk, pale and slender, bearing on its summit a compact head of a
few tiny showless flowers. Its botanical name is Adoxa Moschatellina.

It is summer time before the buttercups begem the pastures; but one
member of the family already welcomes us by hedge-rows; it is the Lesser
Celandine of Wordsworth, which received a special favor from his pen in
the dedication of a pretty little poem. The Lesser Celandine (Ranunculus
Ficaria) grows abundantly on wet shady banks, and produces a profusion of
its bright glossy golden flowers, which, in fading, assume a pure white
hue. This ranks as one of the economical plants of Britain; and humble as
it is, it has been brought forward as a substitute for that unfortunate
vegetable, the potato. Plants of the Lesser Celandine, raised from roots
which had been gathered in Silesia by the Rev. Mr. Wade in 1848, were
grown in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and exhibited by Mr. M'Nab, the
curator of the garden, to the Botanical Society. These roots had been
exposed over a large extent of country in Austria by heavy rains, and the
common people gathered them and used them as an article of food. Their
sudden appearance gave rise to various conjectures as to their nature and
origin, and in the Austrian journals they were spoken of as if they had
fallen from the sky. The "small bodies" (roots) were used as peas by the
inhabitants. Either in a dried state, or when fresh, they are found, on
boiling, to be very amylaceous; that is, they contain much starchy matter.
There is no acridity in the roots even in a fresh state, which is a
remarkable fact when we take into consideration the acrid and poisonous
nature of the entire race of plants allied to it in structure, viz.,
the Ranunculaceæ, to which order it belongs. For instance, one of these
plants, the Indian Aconite, is thus spoken of by Professor Balfour:--

"The root of the plant possesses extreme acrimony, and very marked
narcotic properties. It is said to be the most poisonous of the genus, and
as such has been employed in India. Wallich says that in the Turraye, or
low forest-lands which skirt the approach to Nipal, and among the lower
range of hills, especially at a place called Hetounra, quantities of the
bruised root were thrown into wells and reservoirs, for the purpose of
poisoning our men and cattle. By the vigilant precaution of our troops,
however, these nefarious designs were providentially frustrated. In the
northern parts of Hindoostan, arrows poisoned with the root are used
for destroying tigers. The root, according to Rayle, is sent down into
the plains, and used in the cure of chronic rheumatism, under the name
of _Metha tellia_. Roots, apparently of this plant, were sent by Dr.
Christison from Madras under the name of Nabee. Pereira made a series
of experiments on the roots which had been kept for ten years, and
still retained their poisonous properties. The roots were administered
to animals in the form of a powder, and spirituous and watery extract.
The spirituous extract was the most energetic, the effects produced
being difficulty of breathing, weakness, and subsequent paralysis, which
generally showed itself first in the posterior extremities, vertigo,
convulsions, dilatation of the pupil, and death apparently from asphyxia."

One grain of the alcoholic extract killed a rabbit in nine and a half
minutes, and two grains introduced into the jugular vein of a strong dog
caused death in three minutes.

This is the general character of the crowfoots, and they are indeed the
most destructive cattle poisons that infect our pastures; it is a curious
fact, therefore, that one of them should be so harmless and so nutritious
as we have seen the Lesser Celandine to be; and a still more curious
fact that Linnæus, the father of naturalists, should have thought that
agriculturists should endeavor to extirpate this pretty flower, not only
as acrid and poisonous, but as injurious to all plants growing near it.




BEAUTY.

BY MISS M. H. BUTT.


YES, there is beauty in this world of ours. In looking throughout Nature,
we see its impress everywhere. At early morn, wander forth to the verdant
fields, mark the flowers of every tint, and inhale their perfume. When
Spring dawns, see the trees laden with delicate blossoms, foretelling
a plentiful harvest; watch the tall grass waving so gracefully as the
zephyrs sport there. Surely such a sight is beautiful.

Stop for a moment and list to the murmuring of the streams as they skip on
joyfully; watch the pearly bells which dance upon their brow all sparkling
and bright. Look above, and view the thousand birds on gay wing, singing
so merrily, welcoming the dawn of Spring, and chanting a lay as a requiem
to the departure of Winter. Look around still, and view the myriads of
insects sporting in the sunlight or sipping nectar from flowers. Oh, is
not beauty there?

When Night comes forth with spangled robes and diadem of gems upon her
brow, while each planet and star with tiny harps welcome her coming,
touching those gentle chords, the echo of which glides like a bright
meteor to earth, charming the very soul--is this not beautiful? Or, when
spirits from dream-land watch by our couch during the hours of repose,
painting scenes to enchant us--are they not beautiful?

Nor are all these scenes alone lovely. There is that which hath greater
beauty: it is woman. She stands forth, like some brilliant star, to guide
man through the path of life and cheer his way. Whether she be in the
lofty or lowly walks of life, if she possess certain mental qualifications
and traits of character, she is beautiful. Her beauty does not consist
alone in the bright flashing eye, which seems to speak the sentiments of
her heart; it depends not upon the graceful form or gorgeous equipage;
it is her mind, well cultivated and endowed with all those intellectual
qualifications, which will make her a brilliant star, and which will
enable her to enlighten those with whom she may become conversant. It
may be found, also, in her heart, one which possesses all those fine and
exquisite feelings whereby she can sympathize with the sufferings of
others and minister to their wants. Woman holds a dignified position in
life, and she should cultivate all those traits which will cause her to be
the very pillar of the society in which she moves. Yes, woman is truly
beautiful; she is earth's greatest ornament; of her too much cannot be
said. In whatever light we view her, she is lovely.

Although Nature possesses so much beauty, Art has also her share, for she
endeavors to copy her works and invest them with beauty, as one has said
of man--

    "He plucks the pearls that stud the deep,
      Admiring beauty's lap to fill;
    He breaks the stubborn marble's shape,
      And mocks his own Creator's skill."

Look at the artist, who toils day after day upon a painting which he has
copied from Nature; he endeavors to paint the flowers with accuracy, give
that exquisite emerald hue to the leaves of the trees, the same tints
to the horizon, and that gorgeous light to the sun. Why? He saw beauty
in Nature, and desired to imitate it. The sculptor works with all his
skill upon the bust of some celebrated person, all his power is employed;
he wishes to delineate every feature with accuracy, and determines, if
possible, to accomplish it. Soon he has the gratification of seeing the
soulless and once rugged block of marble transformed into an image of
symmetry and beauty.

Is there not great pleasure to be felt while beholding works of art? We
can but admire and love the fruits of genius. It is very true that there
are many who can look upon the works of art, still no effect will be
produced; yet a person of nice perception and correct taste could gaze for
hours upon them, and see each time something to admire. It is so in Nature
even. Many might walk forth on a lovely morning when Spring first smiles,
yet see no beauty whatever, but merely cast a careless eye upon all
around. One may see much to admire in the storm-cloud which rises darkly
o'er the sea, while streaks of lightning dive 'neath the briny waves,
and the peals of thunder rattle furiously; we may have feelings of awe,
yet, at the same time, see sublimity, and in our hearts we exclaim, "How
beautiful!"

Yes, beauty dwelleth everywhere; from the tiny flower which blooms, to
the stupendous heavens at night lighted with innumerable stars, being the
impress of the One who created all things.




DRESS--AS A FINE ART.

BY MRS. MERRIFIELD.


ORNAMENT--ECONOMY.

ORNAMENT, although not an integral part of dress, is so intimately
connected with it that we must devote a few words to the subject.

Under the general term of ornament, we shall include bows of ribbon,
artificial flowers, feathers, jewels, lace, fringes, and trimming of all
kinds. Some of these articles appear to be suited to one period of life,
some to another. Jewels, for instance, though suitable to middle age, seem
misplaced on youth, which should always be characterized by simplicity
of apparel; while flowers, which are so peculiarly adapted to youth,
are unbecoming to those advanced in years: in the latter case, there is
contrast without harmony--it is like uniting May with December.

The great principle to be observed with regard to ornament is that it
should be appropriate, and appear designed to answer some useful purpose.
A brooch, or a bow of ribbon, for instance, should fasten some part of the
dress; a gold chain should support a watch or an eye-glass. Trimmings are
useful to mark the borders or edges of the different parts of the dress,
and in this light they add to the variety, while by their repetition they
conduce to the regularity of the ornamentation.

The subject of economy in dress, an essential object with many persons,
now claims our attention. We venture to offer a few remarks on this head.
Our first recommendation is to have but few dresses at a time, and those
extremely good. If we have but few dresses, we wear them, and wear them
out while they are in fashion; but, if we have many dresses at once, some
of them become quite old-fashioned before we have done with them. If we
are rich enough to afford the sacrifice, the old-fashioned dress is got
rid of; if not, we must be content to appear in a fashion that has long
been superseded, and we look as if we had come out of the tombs, or as if
one of our ancestors had stepped out of her picture-frame and again walked
the earth.

As to the economy of selecting the best material for dresses, we argue
thus: Every dress must be lined and made up, and we pay as much for making
and lining an inferior article as we do for one of the best quality. Now,
a good silk or merino will wear out two bad ones, therefore one good
dress, lining and making, will cost less than two inferior ones, with the
expenses of lining and making them. In point of appearance, also, there is
no comparison between the two; the good dress will look well to the last,
while one of inferior quality will soon look shabby. When a good silk
dress has become too shabby to be worn longer as a dress, it becomes, when
cut up, useful for a variety of purposes, whereas an inferior silk, or one
purely ornamental, is, when left off, good for nothing.

Plain dresses, that is to say, those of a single color, and without a
pattern, are more economical, as well as more quiet in their appearance,
than those of various colors. They are also generally less expensive,
because something is always paid for the novelty of the fashion; besides,
colored and figured dresses bear the date on the face of them as plainly
as if it was there in printed characters; the ages of dress fabrics are
known by the pattern, therefore dresses of this description should be
put on as soon as purchased, and worn out at once, or they will appear
old-fashioned. There is another reason why dresses of various colors are
less economical than others. Where there are several colors, they may
not all be equally fast, and, if only one of them fades, the dress will
lose its beauty. Trimmings are not economical; besides their cost in the
first instance, they become shabby before the dress, and, if removed, they
generally leave a mark where they have been, and so spoil the appearance
of the dress.

Dresses made of one kind of material only are more durable than those
composed of two, as, for instance, of cotton and silk, of cotton and
worsted, or of silk and worsted. When the silk is merely thrown on the
face of the material, it soon wears off. This is also the case in those
woollen or cotton goods which have a silken stripe.

The question of economy also extends to colors, some of which are much
more durable than others. For this we can give no rule, except that drabs
and other "quaker colors," as they are frequently called, are amongst the
most permanent of all colors. For other colors, we must take the word of
the draper. There is no doubt, however, that the most durable colors are
the cheapest in the end. In the selection of colors, the expense is not
always a criterion; something must be paid for fashion and novelty, and
perhaps for the cost of the dye. The newest and most expensive colors are
not always those which last the longest.

It is not economical to have the dresses made in the extremity of the
fashion, because such soon become remarkable; but the fashions should be
followed at such a distance that the wearer may not attract the epithet of
old-fashioned.

We conclude this part of our subject with a few suggestions relative to
the selection of different styles and materials of dress.

The style of dress should be adapted to the age of the wearer. As a
general rule, we should say that in youth the dress should be simple and
elegant, the ornaments being flowers. In middle age, the dress may be
of rich materials, and more splendid in its character; jewels are the
appropriate ornaments. In the decline of life, the materials of which the
dress is composed may be equally rich, but with less vivacious colors; the
tertiaries and broken colors are particularly suitable, and the character
of the whole costume should be quiet, simple, and dignified. The French,
whose taste in dress is so far in advance of our own, say that ladies who
are fifty years old should neither wear gay colors nor dresses of slight
materials, flowers, feathers, or much jewelry; that they should cover
their hair, wear high dresses, and long sleeves.

Tall ladies may wear flounces and tucks, but they are less appropriate for
short persons. As a general rule, vertical stripes make persons appear
taller than they really are, but horizontal stripes have a contrary
effect. The latter are not admissible in garment fabrics, "since, crossing
the person, the pattern quarrels with all the motions of the human figure,
as well as with the form of the long folds in the skirts of the garment.
For this reason, large and pronounced checks, however fashionable, are
often in bad taste, and interfere with the graceful arrangement of
drapery." Is it to show their entire contempt for the principles of design
that our manufacturers introduced last year not only horizontal stripes
of conspicuous colors, but checks and plaids of immense size, as autumnal
fashions for dress fabrics? We had hoped that the ladies would show the
correctness of their taste by their disapproval of these unbecoming
designs, but the prevalence of the fashion at the present time is another
evidence of the triumph of fashion over good taste.

A white and light-colored dress makes the wearers appear larger, while a
black or dark dress causes them to appear smaller than they actually are.
A judicious person will therefore avail herself of these known effects, by
adopting the style of dress most suitable to her stature.

To sum up in a few words our impressions on this subject, we should say
that the best style of dress is that which, being exactly adapted to
the climate and the individual, is at once modest, quiet, and retiring,
harmonious in color and decoration, and of good materials.

We conclude with the following admirable extract from Tobin's "Honeymoon,"
which we earnestly recommend to the attention of our fair readers:--

    "I'll have no glittering gew-gaws stuck about you,
    To stretch the gaping eyes of idiot wonder,
    And make men stare upon a piece of earth,
    As on the star-wrought firmament--no feathers,
    To wave as streamers to your vanity--
    Nor cumbrous silk, that, with its rustling sound,
    Makes proud the flesh that bears it. She's adorned
    Amply that in her husband's eye looks lovely--
    The truest mirror that an honest wife
    Can see her beauty in!

    _Julia._ I shall observe, sir.

    _Duke._ I should like well to see you in the dress I last presented
    you.

    _Julia._ The blue one, sir?

    _Duke._ No, love--the white. Thus modestly attired,
    A half blown rose stuck in thy braided hair,
    With no more diamonds than those eyes are made of,
    No deeper rubies than compose thy lips,
    Nor pearls more precious than inhabit them,
    With the pure red and white, which that same hand
    Which blends the rainbow mingles in thy cheeks;
    This well-proportioned form (think not I flatter)
    In graceful motion to harmonious sounds,
    And thy free tresses dancing in the wind,
    Thou'lt fix as much observance as chaste dames
    Can meet without a blush."

THE TURKISH COSTUME.

"I REMEMBER," says Mr. St. John, "once seeing a Falstaff fasten his
Kashmire, six or seven yards long, to a door-handle, and having gone with
the other extremity to the opposite side of his court-yard, began to wind
his huge form into it with as much gravity and decorum as if he were
performing a pious mystery. He had a peculiar theory as to the position
of every fold, and if he failed in arranging them exactly, would unwind
himself again with a rapid rotary motion, his hands raised in the air. The
operation, with all its vicissitudes, generally lasted about half an hour;
and I have rarely seen a magnificent Effendi, without thinking of how he
must have looked whilst putting on his shawl."




DAIRY-HOUSE AND PIGGERY.

[Illustration: CHEESE DAIRY-HOUSE.]


WE do not present our readers the following as model cottages; but we give
them a model "Dairy Building" and a model "Piggery." They are from C. M.
Saxton's work on "Rural Architecture."


CHEESE DAIRY-HOUSE.

This building is one and a half stories high, with a broad, spreading roof
of 45° pitch; the ground plan is 10 feet between joists, and the posts 16
feet high. An ice-house is at one end, and a wood-shed at the opposite
end, of the same size. This building is supposed to be erected near the
milking-sheds of the farm, and in contiguity to the feeding-troughs of the
cows, or the piggery, and adapted to the convenience of feeding the whey
to whichever of these animals the dairyman may select, as both, or either
are required to consume it; and to which it may be conveyed in spouts from
the dairy-room.

[Illustration: GROUND PLAN.]

_Interior Arrangement._--The front door is protected by a light porch _a_,
entering by a door _b_, the main dairy-room. The cheese-presses _c_, _c_,
occupy the left end of the room, between which a passage leads through a
door _l_, into the wood-shed _h_, open on all sides, with its roof resting
on four posts set in the ground. The large cheese-table _d_ stands on
the opposite end, and is three feet wide. In the centre of the room is a
chimney _e_, with a whey and water boiler, and vats on each side. A flight
of stairs _f_, leading into the storage-room above, is in the rear. A
door _b_, on the extreme right, leads into the ice-house _g_. There are
four windows to the room--two on each side, front and rear. In the loft
are placed the shelves for storing the cheese, as soon as sufficiently
prepared on the temporary table below. This loft is thoroughly ventilated
by windows, and the heat of the sun upon it ripens the cheese rapidly
for market. A trapdoor, through the floors, over which is hung a tackle,
admits the cheese from below, or passes it down when prepared for market.

The cheese-house should, if possible, be placed on a sloping bank, when
it is designed to feed the whey to pigs; and even when it is fed to cows,
it is more convenient to pass it to them on a lower level than to carry
it out in buckets. It may, however, if on level ground, be discharged
into vats, in a cellar below, and pumped out as wanted. A cellar is
convenient--indeed, almost indispensable--under the cheese dairy; and
water should be so near as to be easily pumped or drawn into the vats and
kettles used in running up the curd, or for washing the utensils used in
the work. When the milk is kept over night for the next morning's curd,
temporary tables may be placed near the ice-room, to hold the pans or
tubs in which it may be set, and the ice used to temper the milk to the
proper degree for raising the cream. If the dairy be of such extent as to
require larger accommodations than the plan here suggested, a room or two
may be partitioned off from the main milk and pressing-room for washing
the vessels and other articles employed, and for setting the milk. Every
facility should be made for neatness in all the operations connected with
the work.

Different accommodations are required for making the different kinds of
cheese which our varied markets demand, and in the fitting up of the
dairy-house, no _positive_ plan of arrangement can be laid down, suited
alike to all the work which may be demanded. The dairyman, therefore, will
best arrange all these for the particular convenience which he requires.
The main plan and style of building, however, we think will be generally
approved, as being in an agreeable architectural style, and of convenient
construction and shape for the objects intended.


PIGGERY.

THE design here given is for a building 36 feet long and 24 feet wide,
with twelve-feet posts; the lower, or living-room for the swine, 9 feet
high, and a storage chamber above for the grain and other food required
for his keeping. The roof has a pitch of 40° from a horizontal line,
spreading over the sides and gables at least 20 inches, and coarsely
bracketed. The entrance front projects 6 feet from the main building, by
12 feet in length. Over its main door, in the gable, is a door with a
hoisting beam and tackle above it, to take in the grain, and a floor over
the whole area receives it. A window is in each gable end. A ventilator
passes up through this chamber and the roof, to let off the steam from the
cooking vats below, and the foul air emitted by the swine, by the side of
which is the furnace-chimney, giving it, on the whole, as respectable an
appearance as a pigsty need pretend to.

_Interior Arrangement._--At the left of the entrance is a flight of stairs
_b_, leading to the chamber above. On the right is a small area _a_, with
a window to light it. A door from this leads into the main room _c_, where
stands a chimney _d_, with a furnace to receive the fuel for cooking the
food, for which are two kettles, or boilers, with wooden vats on the top,
if the extent of food demands them; these are secured with broad wooden
covers, to keep in the steam when cooking. An iron valve is placed in the
back flue of the furnace, which may fall upon either side, to shut off the
fire from either of the kettles, around which the fire may revolve; or the
valve may stand in a perpendicular position, at will, if both kettles be
heated at the same time. But, as the most economical mode is to cook one
kettle while the other is in process of feeding out, and _vice versa_,
scarcely more than one at a time will be required in use. Over each kettle
is a sliding door, with a short spout to slide the food into them when
wanted. If necessary, and it can be conveniently done, a well may be sunk
under this room, and a pump inserted at a convenient place; or, if equally
convenient, a pipe may bring the water in from a neighboring stream or
spring. On three sides of this room are feeding pens _e_, and sleeping
partitions _f_, for the swine. These several apartments are accommodated
with doors, which open into separate yards on the sides and in rear, or a
large one for the entire family, as may be desired.

_Construction._--The frame of this building is of strong timber, and stout
for its size. The sills should be eight inches square, the corner posts
of the same size, and the intermediate posts 8 by 6 inches in diameter. In
the centre of these posts, grooves should be made, two inches wide, and
deep, to receive the _plank_ sides, which should be two inches thick, and
let in from the level of the chamber by a flush cutting for that purpose,
out of the grooves inside, thus using no nails or spikes, and holding the
planks tight in their place that they may not be rooted out or rubbed off
by the hogs, and the inner projection of the main posts left to serve as
rubbing posts for them. Above the chamber floor thinner planks may be
used. The centre post in the floor plan of the engraving is omitted, by
mistake, but it should stand there, like the others. Inside posts at the
corners, and in the sides of the partitions, like the outside ones, should
be also placed and grooved to receive the planking, four and a half feet
high, and their upper ends be secured by tenons into mortices in the beams
overhead. The troughs should be made of cast-iron, or the hardest white
oak plank, strongly spiked on to the floor and sides.

THE INTERVIEW.

BY T. HEMPSTEAD.

    THERE are oracles true in the depths of the mind,
    There are prophecies borne on the wings of the wind,
    There are omens that dwell in a flower or a leaf,
    To unbosom the future, its rapture and grief;
    There are voices of night with a language as plain
    As the accents of love or the moanings of pain,
    And I turn from the glare and the murmur of day,
    To the warnings and woes which their whispers betray.

    There is gloom on thy brow, there is grief in thine eye,
    There is night in thy heart, on thy lip is a sigh,
    And thy summer of beauty has faded away,
    Like a dream from the brain, like a leaf from the spray
    Oh! dark must the cloud of thy sorrow have been,
    And mighty the fetter that bound thee, and keen
    As the fangs of despair, as the arrows of Death,
    As the terrors that rain from the hurricane's breath,
    Thus to wilder thy brain, thus to wither thy brow,
    As thou standest before me all tremblingly now.
    Thou art come to my hall with the sound of the storm;
    Oh, the tears of his pity flow fast from thy form,
    And the beams on thy face but a shadow impart
    Of the strength of the woe that is wringing thy heart.
    In the silence that midnight around me hath thrown,
    In moments the brightest my bosom hath known,
    In the gloom of the tomb, on the slope of the wave,
    Where the green hills grew red with the life of the brave,
    In its desert of sorrow, its garden of bliss,
    My heart hath dreamed never of meeting like this!
    My Inez, the love of my manhood, my bride,
    Who art won from the arms of the grave to my side,
    From the last hour thy brow to my bosom was prest,
    Have thy tones and thy form been a shrine in my breast;
    Thou hast haunted my steps when the breathings of spring,
    The light swallow and bee to the water-brink bring;
    In the calm of the hills, by the blue rushing streams,
    I have gazed in thine eye through the mist of my dreams;
    Thou art come with the storm and the banners of night,
    Pale Inez, the love of my youth, my delight!
    Like a wreck from the wave, like a shade from the tomb,
    Thou art now at my side, and thy step in my room,
    But the glory that beamed 'neath thy lashes is gone,
    There is woe in thy mien, there is grief in thy tone,
    And the beauty that fed on those sweet lips of thine
    Has died with the lustre that made it divine.
    Where the dim-whispered sounds that gave ear to our vows
    Were the audible steppings of God in the boughs;
    By the beaming of stars through the tremulous vine,
    Thou didst pledge through the rolling of years to be mine!
    Let oblivion steal from my bosom that hour--
    May the frosts of forgetfulness wither that bower;
    They have darkened my soul, they have furrowed my brow,
    But my manhood no more to that sceptre shall bow!

    Thou wast won by the perishing glitter of gold,
    From my heart to the arms of another wast sold,
    Who hath cast thee away as a scorn, as a weed,
    On the love of a world that hath doomed thee to bleed.
    Like a palace whose feasting and music are ended,
    Whose lights to the dim gulf of death are descended,
    Whose footfalls are silent, whose arches lie strown,
    Where the cold wind of night makes a desolate moan,
    Thy trusted hath left thee, deserted, alone,
    To the rains and the ivy, sad, beautiful one!
    Had thy heart been as true--ah, no! never my tongue
    May add gall to the grief that thy spirit hath wrung;
    'Tis enough that I gaze on thee here as thou art,
    On the wreck of thy hope, in thy ruin of heart,
    Who art drifting right on to that desolate shore
    Where the storm of thy sorrow shall chase thee no more.

    As I slept, o'er my spirit strange terrors there came,
    Wrought with drapery of midnight, in crimson and flame,
    Dread as death-fires that burn on the fear-smitten eye,
    When the far-shaking thunder-tramp reels through the sky.
    On a fragment that flew from the van of the blast,
    Like a leaf on the stream of the hurricane cast,
    Now spurned from their bosom, now hid in the abyss
    Of black waves that sparkle, crack, thunder, and hiss,
    It was thou on my breast through the war of the storm,
    Pale, pale as the shroud that shall compass thy form.
    There was death on the gale, there was night on the sea,
    Where I sat on that wreck with the tempest and thee;
    Through darkness and thunder, flash, shriek, din, and foam,
    Now deep-clasped in the vale, and now rocked on the dome
    Of the wave, I was borne o'er the windy expanse
    Of chill vapor and spray by the terrible glance
    Of the lightning; I pressed thy cold cheek unto mine;
    From thy locks fast down-trickled the luminous brine;
    By thy breath on my brow, by the serpentine path
    Of the death-flame that blazed on its journey of wrath,
    I knew thee; I knew, my beloved, thou wast there,
    In the battle of waves, through my night of despair.
    Lips of blood through the gloom, and pale phantoms of fear
    Howled the peals of their horrible glee in my ear;
    The thin fingers of demons stooped round me to clasp,
    To wring thy cold form from the strength of my grasp;
    With their dim eyes upturned, newly torn from the grave,
    Glared the dead from their weltering shrouds on the wave;
    Oh! dark was the struggle and fearful and vain
    Thy cold limbs from their place in the deep to restrain;
    Dread as Death the black bulk of a surge rumbled o'er,
    I clasped thee, I felt thee, I saw thee no more!

    That vision of woe, that wild dream of the sea,
    Is fulfilled, O pale, desolate weeper, in thee;
    No more shall the joy of thy glance on me shine;
    While the sun on me beams, I may never be thine;
    Yet know in thy sorrow, sad Inez, my love,
    Thou art mine in the Eden that blossoms above!
    Ah, the pent tears, at last, 'neath thy dark lashes start,
    And the words that would heal it have broken thy heart.

SONNET.--CLOUDS.

BY WM. ALEXANDER.

    YE welcome clouds! what praises have ye won!
      Host after host ye ever thronging come,
      Careering on athwart the ethereal dome,
    To tell of tempests past or hastening on.
    With magic hues ye often deck the sky,
      Enamelling it with red and purple, gold;
      Like molten silver oft ye are unrolled,
    And oft changed into palaces, ye lie.
    The rainbow oft is pictured on your breast,
      To tell of peace and plenty ye do bring;
      Hail, snow, ye bear oft 'neath your ebon wing,
    And tempests in your blackest mantle rest.
    The thirsty earth ye wet with freshening showers,
    Floods flowing from ye speak your desolating powers.

WILLIE MAYLIE.

BY CORNELIA M. DOWLING.

    OH! do you not remember, love,
      The sunny morn when we were plighted?
    Your eye was bright in loving light,
      And dancing like a star benighted.
    That eye is dim and sunken now,
      But still around it love reposes;
    And bright the smile upon your cheek,
      Though withered long are all its roses.
    Oh! my Willie Maylie dear,
    My true, my noble Willie Maylie,
          Years have rolled,
          And we are old,
    But _still together_, Willie Maylie!

    And do you not remember, love,
      The baby bright we used to cherish,
    Not dreaming that so fair a bud
      Might early fade away and perish?
    Oh! sad it seemed to lay the form
      So bright upon an earthy pillow;
    Now, she is softly sleeping, love,
      Alone, beneath the drooping willow!
    Oh! my Willie Maylie dear,
    My loving, earnest Willie Maylie,
          Roses bloom
          Upon the tomb
    Of her we loved, my Willie Maylie!

    And do you not remember, love,
      That we have journeyed long together,
    The heart-light ever gilding o'er
      The path of life in wintry weather?
    We've almost crossed the ocean now,
      Still breasting every billow gayly;
    We soon shall reach the heavenly shore,
      And rest together, Willie Maylie!
    Oh! my Willie Maylie dear,
    My own true-hearted Willie Maylie,
          Heart to heart,
          And ne'er to part,
    We'll rest together, Willie Maylie!

ELLIE MAYLIE.

BY JENNIE DOWLING DE WITT.

    THE light of other days, my love,
      Is o'er my vision softly stealing;
    The music of thy bridal vows,
      Like harp-notes, up the past is pealing.
    But lip, nor eye, nor sunny brow,
      Nor cheek with witching dimples lighted,
    Were half so dear to me as now,
      When years have proved the love we plighted.
    Oh! my Ellie Maylie dear,
    My ever-winning Ellie Maylie,
          Love like thine
          To hearts like mine
    Is air and sunlight, Ellie Maylie.

    Down Youth's bright tide, our shallop light
      Went floating on through banks of flowers;
    But riper years brought clouds and night,
      For Life must have both _sun_ and _showers_
    Well _might_ thy Willie brave the storm,
      And "breast the adverse billow gayly;"
    For what were Youth and Flowers to Love,
      Or all the world to Ellie Maylie
    Oh! my Ellie Maylie dear,
    My artless, clinging Ellie Maylie,
          Breath to being,
          Eye to seeing,
    Wert thou to me, my Ellie Maylie.

    Not where above a little grave
      The early summer buds are springing,
    Where willows in the sunlight wave,
      Not there--not there my heart is clinging;
    But _there_, amid those deathless flowers,
      That up from Heav'n's pure soil are springing,
    Where waits that angel-babe of ours,
      'Tis there--'tis there my heart is clinging!
    Oh! my Ellie Maylie dear,
    My gentle, trusting Ellie Maylie,
          Lulled to rest
          On Jesus' breast,
    We'll meet in Heav'n, my Ellie Maylie!

THERE'S MUSIC.

BY HORACE G. BOUGHMAN.

    THERE'S solemn music in the billows
      Of the mighty, restless sea;
    Lively music poured from brooklets,
      As they gambol in their glee.

    There's stirring music in the gale;
      Soft music in the breeze;
    Music sweet when winged minstrels
      Carol 'mid the verdant trees.

    There's awful music in the thunders;
      Lulling music in the rains;
    Music echoed from the forest,
      In a thousand living strains.

    There's silent music in the flowers,
      And in the planet's genial fires;
    Music grandest in the rivers,
      Where they tune their cat'ract lyres.

    There 's cheering music all around us,
      Thrilling music from above;
    And those magic tones should teach us
      Sweeter, nobler strains of love.

DREAM PICTURE.

AN IMPROMPTU.

BY MRS. A. F. LAW.

    BEHOLD, upon Life's swelling tide,
    A little boat doth gently glide!
    Its freight a Soul; Sin guides the helm,
    And steers for Pleasure's baseless realm:
    At prow, the gay-robed Tempter stands,
    Obscuring, with his jewelled hands,
    The Spirit's view; whilst shines afar
    Hope's radiant, but _deceiving_ star;
    For, see, _it fades_, e'en as we gazing stand,
    And leaves that bark a wreck upon the strand!

I WAS ROBBED OF MY SPIRIT'S LOVE.

BY JARONETTE.

    ON! give me some strong human will,
      To lull this dream of woe;
    It binds me with its iron chain,
      And will not let me go.
    Oh! give me strength to curb this strife,
      And make my spirit know
    My early days of happy life,
      Of days long, long ago.

    But now there's darkness on my path,
      A shadow on my heart;
    I each fond feeling seek to hide,
      Trembling in ev'ry part!
    They think that I'm forgetting thee;
      But ah! they do not see
    The coursing tears, when I'm alone,
      Flowing so fast and free!

    I list my bird's sweet matin song,
      Its wild and gladsome chants;
    But no, the dead'ning weight is here,
      And still my spirit pants
    For long-lost dreamy hours of joy,
      When thou wert by my side,
    And care seemed but a thing of name,
      Not to my life allied.

    Now, when the smile is on my lip,
      It turns that smile to tears,
    Stemming the life-blood of my heart
      With weary weight of years.
    It makes the strong proud limbs refuse
      To roam this gladsome earth,
    And sends me reeling, mad, within,
      From out the sounds of mirth.

    I pet each blossom from my shrubs,
      And call them by thy name;
    I ask them if their spirits tell
      That I am still the same.
    A pure white rose that bloomed this morn
      I went this eve to take;
    "The spirit of the flow'r" had fled,
      The _cold_ its _heart_ did break!

    They tell me that thou carest not
      For woman's love or fame;
    That thou speak'st _lightly_ of them all
      That bear the gentle name.
    But oh! I heed them not the while,
      _They_ have not read thy heart;
    I know you have not chang'd so much
      Since we were forced to part.

    And though they bid me see thee not,
      My spirit meets thee oft
    In dream-land, where the flow'rs bloom bright,
      The air so calm and soft.
    The angels then are by my side,
      They kiss me with thy lips,
    And clasp hope's rainbow round my heart,
      In that dream-hour of bliss.

    And sometimes in thy weary hours
      Recall the past, and weave
    The dream of hallowed love and hope
      I'll ever for thee breathe.
    Then wander forth amid the throng,
      And seek some gentle one,
    One that will honor thy dear name,
      And take her _to thy home_.

THE ELIXIR OF LIFE.

BY CHARLES ALBERT JANVIER.

The following lines were suggested by a remark in Washington Irving's
"Student of Salamanca," that the old alchymist died just as he was on the
point of discovering the philosopher's stone.

    THE walls were sweating with a festering damp,
      An icy coldness filled the dreary room,
    A little solitary flickering lamp
      With sickly radiance glimmered through the gloom,
    While on a tattered couch an old man lay,
    Half-starved with hunger, weary, gaunt, and gray.

    His feeble eyes with ardor yet were strained
      Upon a yellow parchment dull with age,
    As, while one lingering ray of life remained,
      That single ray must shine on Learning's page;
    And while he lay immersed in study deep,
    He murmured thus, as one who speaks in sleep:--

    "One little hour more, and all is mine!
      Mine the bright prize so long I've sought in vain!
    Mine the lost secret, which for countless time
      Philosophers have labored to regain!
    Mine wealth, and youth, and joy, and nevermore,
    O Death! shall I be subject to thy power!

    "One hour more, and all these golden dreams
      Which still have cheered me on from day to day,
    Shall be no more like fleeting radiant beams,
      Glancing one moment bright, then snatched away;
    But all my visions, howe'er bright their hue,
    No more be false, no more be aught but true!

    "Ye elementary spirits, who so long
      With ready wiles have baffled all my art
    One hour more, and I in power strong
      Shall see ye all in helpless rage depart!
    At last your devilish malice all o'erthrown,
    At last the great elixir all my own!"

    Thus spoke the alchymist; but ruthless Death,
      Who strikes alike the mighty and the low,
    And stops the monarch's and plebeian's breath
      With equal haste, and with the selfsame blow,
    Had laid his icy hand upon his heart,
    While bidding him in iron tones "depart!"

    The lamp burnt lower, still his eye was fixed
      Upon the parchment, while his trembling hand
    Within a crucible the compound mixed,
      With which completed he would soon command
    Unending treasure, boundless glittering wealth,
    The priceless draught of endless youth and health.

    But from his stiffening band the parchment dropped,
      As from his lips broke forth a hollow moan,
    The coursing current of his life-blood stopped,
      His spirit fled just as its task was done!
    Closing his eyes upon the lifelong strife,
    He left untouched the sparkling cup of Life.

THE SONG-BIRDS OF SPRING.

BY NORMAN W. BRIDGE.

    FROM out the airy balcony
      Of many a sylvan cot and dome,
    Is poured soul-melting minstrelsy,
      That cheers my lonely heart and home.
    Around each warbler's chosen haunt
      Are heard sweet notes of joy and praise;
    From fruit-trees comes the robin's chant,
      And from each bush the sparrow's lays.

    Amid the poplar's trembling lyre,
      That o'er the lawn its shadow throws,
    Rich warblings of a linnet-choir
      My soul with melody o'erflows;
    While from a willow waving near,
      And where the vine its trellis girds,
    Steals softly o'er the tuneful ear
      The symphony of yellow-birds.

    Upon the elm-tree's lofty bough
      The oriole serenely sings,
    While from a puerile branch below
      His loved one in her castle swings:
    And in the flower-enamelled leas,
      Where alders grace the streamlet's brink,
    I hear the charming melodies
      Of many a sweet-voiced bobolink.

    And from yon wildwood's emerald crown
      Come oft, in notes of heavenly tone,
    The hymns of thrushes, "wood," and "brown,"
      And warbling throats to me unknown.
    Bird-notes are all so rich and clear,
      It seems as though their vocal powers
    Were borrowed from some higher sphere
      Than this discordant world of ours.

    Nor is their magic gift of song
      The only charm they o'er me throw;
    They ne'er the poor and helpless wrong,
      Nor swell the tide of human woe.
    Their voice is ne'er with slander fraught,
      Or friendships in misfortune change,
    Nor speech or deed betrayeth aught
      Of av'rice, hatred, and revenge.

    They seek not, with malicious tongue,
      To stir the bosom with mistrust,
    By telling what 's been said and sung,
      How all our faults have been discussed;
    Till Jealousy within awakes,
      And Love with doubt is much annoyed,
    The golden clasp of Friendship breaks,
      And peace of families destroyed.

    No rival's fame they derogate,
      A brother falsely charge with sin,
    Hoping thereby to elevate
      Their name above more worthy kin:
    They seem not e'er to envy those
      Whose brilliant plumes their own outshine,
    Or to rejoice at others' woes
      Whose powers of song are more divine.

    Nor have their hearts the cruel pride
      O'er humbler garbs and gifts to sneer;
    The lame, their hapless fate deride,
      Or o'er the weak to domineer.
    No bitter taunt, unfeeling jest,
      The boast of pow'r, wealth, rank, or birth,
    E'er flow from soaring warbler's breast,
      To wound the heart of lowly worth.

    Nor do they play the hypocrite
      With faithful, fond, confiding friends,
    Looks, manners, language counterfeit,
      To gain ignobly selfish ends.
    No word or act their aim belies,
      Or yield they e'er to sin's control,
    And sell, for worldly merchandise,
      The jewels of a virtuous soul.

A MOTHER'S LOVE.

TO A YOUNG FRIEND.

BY MARY NEAL.

    THY heart is young and light, maiden;
      Thy sunny brow is fair;
    For Love, and Joy, and Hope now weave
      Life's brightest sunbeams there.
    Brothers and sisters turn to bless
      Thy ever-welcome form,
    And a father's arm is near to shield
      Thee from life's lightest storm.

    But more, still more than this, maiden--
      A mother's heart is near,
    To watch thy fair cheek, pale or flush--
      To note each starting tear--
    To gaze upon thy happy face,
      And pray that thy young heart
    May long be spared the bitter woe
      From cherished friends to part.

    Oh, Love will make fond hearts, maiden,
      To offer at thy shrine;
    And Friendship many a blooming wreath
      Around thy path entwine:
    But the tears that o'er thy restless couch
      From a mother's eyes were shed,
    Will moist a green spot in thy heart
      When _those_ bright flowers are dead!

    Then watch those loving eyes, maiden,
      That beam upon thee now;
    And cherish every silver hair
      That stealeth o'er that brow:
    For a mother's love's the purest ray,
      The brightest day-star given,
    To light us o'er Life's darkened way,
      And lead us up to Heaven.

    OH, where art thou, beloved one, at this hour,
    So meet for fond affection's holy power,
    For all the tender memories that will
    The lonely bosoms of the absent fill?

    Far, far away! Yet as my tearful eye
    Dwells on yon little watchfire in the sky,
    This thought comes stealing on its beam of light,
    _Our hearts shall meet at Mercy's throne to-night_!

TO IDA.

BY HORACE PHELPS, M. D.

    THE gale is fresh upon my brow,
      The evening dew my cheek has wet,
    The bark moves merrily, and now
      The moonlight and the wave have met;
    The mountain heights their shadows throw,
      In dark and frowning majesty,
    Upon the rolling waters' flow,
      As sorrows cross young memory:
    What wants this scene to be divine?
    Thy gentle heart to beat with mine.

    The lover's star her watch doth keep
      In the blue vault of yonder sky;
    While all around is hushed to sleep,
      I deem thy angel spirit nigh;
    'Twere rapture never felt before
      In this serene and midnight noon,
    To hear from yonder lonely shore
      The watch-dog bay the full bright moon,
    Couldst thou be here to share this hour
    My heart's beloved and buried flower.

    There is a spirit rides the air;
      I hear its murmur on the stream,
    I see its form of beauty fair
      Disporting in the moonlight beam
    It is the spirit of delight
      Of young affection's ecstasy,
    And in its form and features bright
      Thine own fair face and form I see:
    It hovers o'er my head, and now
    I feel its hand upon my brow.

    I see the light of feeling play
      And sparkle in its winning smile,
    To chase my brooding cares away,
      And all my sorrows to beguile;
    I hear the voice I loved to hear
      Mix with the music of the stream;
    The well-known accents strike my ear:
      Away! 'tis fancy's wildest dream:
    I am alone beneath the star,
    And thou art in thy grave afar!

THE _WAS_ AND THE _IS_.

BY O. EVERTS, M. D.

    AWAY in the mist of past ages,
      The _was-life_ of wondrous renown--
    (Which lives but in History's pages,
      And the tales which Traditions hand down,
      Or in marbles that still o'er us frown)--

    Yet looks as if towering away
      Far above all the _Is_ or _To-be_
    And a power still seemeth to sway,
      Though the present convulse to be free,
      And the future no prophet-eyes see.

    But only it seemeth--not real!
      A shadowy monster untruth!
    An image of vapors ideal,
      That floats in the sky of our youth,
      Ere we see with strong visions in sooth!

    And thus, while we gaze it departs,
      And a better, a nobler appears;
    The _Is-life_ more wonderful starts
      From its home in the heavenly spheres,
      And fills us with hopes and with fears!

    And we rise, while our hearts strongly beat,
      And say to our fears, all begone!
    They vanish, like clouds that retreat
      Before the all-conquering sun--
      And we nerve for the deeds to be done!

    Ah! now does the youth feel his strength!
      See his cheeks, how they glow! and his eye,
    How it sparkles and gleams! till at length
      His soul reaches out to the sky,
      And his thoughts through the universe fly!

    And his steps are elastic as air,
      Yet consciously proud--and his tread
    Over ruins of temples that were--
      And religion whose priesthoods are dead,
      Is as if _there_ no prayer had been said.

    The _Is-life_ is now all to him!
      With a glance toward the future, inspired
    He moves with his might every limb--
      His soul with ambition is fired--
      And he grows in his task never tired.

    He triumphs! The truth is his sword,
      And the _shams_ and the _phantoms_ that are,
    Shrink back to antiquity's horde,
      To be buried with falsehoods that were,
      Whilst fame everlasting's his share!

    Oh! the _Is_ is the life then for me!
      The _Was_ had its tasks and its men;
    And others will crowd the _To-be_,
      And laugh at all this that hath been--
      But to me, what matters it then?

       *       *       *       *       *


THE LAST MOMENTS.

BY R. GRIFFIN STAPLES.

    IT was a beauteous eve! On high,
      The moon's bright silver ray,
    And stars gleamed softly down, to guide
      The traveller's weary way.

    Gently the balmy breath of night
      Sighed o'er the distant lea,
    And birds their cheerful warblings hushed
      With eve's serenity.

    The shades of death were falling slow
      Within a chamber, where
    A meek one lay, and, sinking, gazed
      Into a world more fair.

    Sweet hour for one so pure to die,
      To pass from earth away
    To that bright land where naught corrupts,
      And all is "perfect day."

    "Father!" she breathed, "Thy will be done!"
      And closed her eyes in death;
    "Father!" re-echoed through the sky,
      "Thy will be done on earth!"

NETTED CAP, FOR MORNING WEAR.

    _Materials._--Crochet thread, No. 4; and, to embroider the pattern,
    a skein of pink or blue Shetland wool, or embroidery cotton, No. 16;
    steel mesh, No. 14, and a flat ivory mesh, one quarter of an inch
    in width--this will make an ordinary cap; but, if any other size is
    required, the meshes and thread must be coarser or finer.

COMMENCE with the crochet thread, and No. 14 mesh, on a foundation of 20
stitches; work 40 rows of 20 stitches each. This piece forms the centre
of the crown, cut it off the foundation, and run a string along the four
sides, about four or five stitches from the edges, so as to work all round
the square.

_1st round._--Work down the first side thus: net a stitch plain, then net
2 stitches in one stitch, 15 plain, 2 stitches in one, 2 plain, and along
the other side, *, net 2 stitches in one, 15 plain, 2 stitches in one, and
2 plain. Repeat from * twice more.

_2d._--Net 3 plain then (2 stitches in one, and 10 plain, 8 times).

_3d._--Plain.

_4th._--(Net 11 plain, and 2 stitches in one, 8 times.)

It will now be advisable to take out the string, and run it into the 1st
round to keep the work even. Net 15 rounds plain.

_20th._--Net 2 stitches in one, then 20 plain, 2 stitches in one, 79
plain. Net 4 rounds more the same as last, working 2 stitches more at the
end of each round, so that the 20 plain stitches are always over those of
the preceding round; when finished, turn back. Net to within 20 stitches
of the end of the round, turn back again, and leaving the 20 stitches
to form the back of the cap, work for the front, 8 rows plain, netting
two stitches in the last stitch of each row. Then 12 rows plain without
increasing; and for the foundation of the border double the cotton and
work 6 rows plain.

[Illustration]

Embroider the cap with the pink wool in darning stitch, passing the needle
about 6 times in each square of the netting.

THE BORDER.--With the thread, and No. 14 mesh, net 6 stitches plain, and
continue working backwards and forwards for about 9 yards; then to form.

THE EDGE.--Run a string in the loops which form the selvedge, so as to
work on the other selvedge.

_1st row._--With flat mesh, net 4 stitches in every other stitch of the
selvedge.

_2d._--With 14 mesh, plain netting, working a stitch in every stitch of
the first row. Then, with the pink wool, embroider the plain netting.

To make up the cap, sew a row of the border to the last thick row of the
cap, fulling it at the ears, plain across the front to the centre, then
draw 5 loops close together to make it rather pointed, plain again, and
full at the other ear, and across the back, sew on another row of the
border the same, attaching it to the first thick row; then sew on a third
border, very full, and in a zigzag form on the ears, but the same as
before across the front.

THE STRINGS.--With the thread and No. 14 mesh, net 12 stitches, and
continue working backwards and forwards for 5 inches, then net 2 stitches
in one at the end of every third row, until it is increased to 28
stitches; then net 8 rows, leaving 3 stitches unworked at the end of each
row; and for

THE EDGE.--With the flat mesh, commence in the last stitch of the side,
and net 4 stitches in every other stitch across the uneven rows; then one
row plain, with No. 14 mesh. Work another string the same, and embroider
them as the cap.

OUR readers can scarcely imagine the difficulty we meet with in presenting
_novelties_ in this department. The shades of fashion are so various, and
yet so slight, that, in giving new designs from month to month, those not
accustomed to scrutinize closely may not notice the peculiarities they are
intended to present, or that each month has its peculiar and seasonable
adaptation. For instance--

[Illustration: APRON IN BRODERIE EN LACET.]

Fig. 1, a wrought lace chemisette and stomacher, is intended for the
mild opening season, when cambric embroideries would be too heavy for the
style of dress. The prevailing form of the opening of the basque corsage
is also denoted by it--low, square, or a broad oval on the bust. The
construction of the chemisette of broad scalloped lace, is simple enough,
on a foundation of Grecian net or coach blonde.

Fig. 2 is an undersleeve to correspond, made sufficiently loose at the
wrist for the hand to pass through. The box plaiting or quilling of satin
ribbon, which heads the lace in both Figs. 1 and 2, is fastened in the
sleeve by a rosette. This is of course only caught on, and is easily
removed when the lace is to be done up; it may be of any shade, and is
very stylish in evening dress.

Fig. 3 is a rather close morning cap for a lady of middle age, made of
alternate rows of clean muslin puffs and fine Valenciennes insertion. It
has a crown, front piece, and frill. The border is a medium Valenciennes
edge sewn in the insertion, two rows slightly frilled. Bows and strings of
violet-colored satin ribbon.

Fig. 4.--Breakfast cap for a young married lady, consisting of a crown
piece, and two rows of edging, of Maltese lace. Bows and ends of rich
ribbon, medium width between the rows, a knot of broader ribbon behind,
a little to the right. For description of _Maltese_ lace, see fashion
article.

[Illustration]


APRON IN BRODERIE EN LACET.

(_See Blue Plate in front of Book._)

    _Materials._--Seven-eighths of a yard of wide black glace silk,
    two knots of cerise Russia silk braid, one knot of pale vert-islay
    ditto, and a dozen skeins of sewing-silk to match each braid.

BRODERIE EN LACET signifies a design out-lined as if merely for braiding,
but with the flowers and other parts filled in with point lace stitches,
so as to make a solid piece of embroidering on the silk. For no article is
this novel style of work more suitable than for aprons, which it renders
exceedingly ornamental, at a very small expenditure of time and trouble,
the very simplest of the point lace stitches only being used in this work.
Of course, the size of our page precludes our giving even the half of the
apron the full size. The design must be enlarged according to the size
required, the pattern procured, and the silk marked in the same way as
ordinary braiding or embroidery.

Braiding should always be done with a strand of the silk of which the
braid is made. Before beginning, cut off a yard of the braid and draw
out the threads for sewing with. Thread the end of the braid on a large
darning-needle, and draw it through the silk to the wrong side for the
commencement, and do the same at every necessary break, sending the ends
down. Run the braid on very smoothly, taking the stitches across it
slanting and cut along the centre, as is usually done. The braid should
lie perfectly flat, and the edges be smooth and even.

The knots at the side suspending the wreath are done in the green braid,
the two parallel lines of which are connected by close herring-bone
stitch, or point d'Alençon, as it is called in lace-work. All the fancy
stitches are done with the common sewing-silk, not with the strands of
the braid. The leaves need have merely the veinings worked in Venetian
bars; those, however, who do not mind the trouble, will do well to fill
them first with Brussels lace, and work the fibres over that; the improved
effect will quite repay the extra work. The roses are filled up closely
in the Brussels and Venetian lace, the narrow parts being connected
with English bars. The lower part of each bud has a rosette in it, the
remainder is filled with Venetian lace.

JACKET FOR A RIDING-DRESS.

[Illustration]

THE material is merino, or very fine lady's cloth; the color a light shade
of cinnamon brown. The basque, or skirt, at the waist is rather long, and
the jacket is edged all round with a Greek border in soutache. It is made
rather open in front, so as to show a waistcoat of plain blue cashmere
fastened with gold buttons. The collar to be worn with this jacket is
of cambric, and may be either worked or plain. The undersleeves, also
of cambric, are full, and the fulness gathered at the wrists on bands
of needlework. Necktie of black velvet. Our illustration shows only the
jacket of this riding-dress; but we may mention that the skirt of the
habit should be of the same material, and that the hat worn with it should
be of gray felt, ornamented with a feather of the same color, and the
crown encircled by a band of blue ribbon fastened in a rosette on one side.

EDITORS' TABLE.


WE put aside, for this month, a number of short articles, in order to
give our readers the pleasure of an introduction to the celebrated
singing-master, to whose instructions the Swedish Nightingale owes,
in a great measure, the restoration of her wonderful voice, and her
unequalled power in using it. Very important lessons are contained in this
interesting sketch, translated from the German of Elise Polko.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Rue Chabannais, No._ 6.--In one of the most insignificant streets of
splendid Paris, the narrow little Rue Chabannais, there stands a tall,
dark-looking house known as No. 6. Ugly, rambling, old-fashioned buildings
stand on each side, and have posted themselves opposite to it also,
like old duennas mounting guard, squinting down incessantly with their
dim eyes, their unwashed windows, upon the gray house with its broad
doorway. The inhabitants of the little street, on the contrary, regard it
with a certain pride mingled with a tender friendliness of feeling, and
rejoice like children over each brilliant equipage that stays its rapid
course before No. 6, as well as over every unpretending fiacre that there
deposits its light burden.

At all hours of the day, graceful female figures glide over the threshold
of the large dark house, and the _modiste_ of the Rue Chabannais, who
arranges her fluttering caps, ribbons, and veils so invitingly in the
corner window, might make valuable studies for costume from the many
and divers figures, great and small, who so heedlessly pass by her
well-displayed treasures. One may see rich heavy silks, and simple black
woollen robes, superb velvet mantillas and delicate light shawls, the
careless and yet striking costume, the carefully-chosen and usually
brilliant garb of slender German women, the elegant and coquettish French
bonnet, and the great roof-like straw hat which shelters the fair brow of
the English lady. One might be tempted to think some skilful gardener must
have his abode here, and all the flowers were flocking to him for advice
about their tender lives, from the glorious exotic of the greenhouse to
the humblest field flower that needs only its drop of dew.

But men too, young and old, whose figures and faces remind us neither of
flowers nor spring, enter mysterious No. 6 with rapid steps, and strangely
do their countenances differ in expression as they come out again.
Sometimes there is a bright smile and a beaming eye, but most of them have
a deep and earnest look, and a brow furrowed with anxious thought--traces
which vanish soon enough in the Place Louvois or the gay and brilliant Rue
Richelieu.

"Perhaps a second Lenormand has fixed her residence in the large house,
disclosing strange secrets to the curious, and uttering dark oracles!" Ah,
no! such magicians are sought only under cover of twilight and the dark
shadows of night--never in bright day.

Now, shall I solve the riddle of the gray house? Will you follow me up
the broad stone stairway? Forward, then! Many a light foot has lingered
anxiously on these steps, doubtful whether to go further; this iron
railing has been touched by many a trembling hand, and these white walls
have echoed many a sigh. At last we have mounted the third flight; let us
take breath! Many a young heart has beat audibly before this closed door,
believe me! for we are standing before the dwelling of

    MANUEL GARCIA,

the greatest singing-master of our time.

One of the most charming of fairies (and I tell you for your comfort
there are still many of them who, to escape the roar and tumult of our
mad world, hide themselves far down in the flower-cups), at my earnest
request, has lent me her fragrant veil for an hour or two; we wrap it
around us and are invisible, and now we can boldly enter the rooms of the
artist. Passing through a small antechamber, we carefully open a folding
door on the right, and enter a simple apartment, partially darkened, and
tastefully and comfortably furnished. Two beautiful busts arrest our
attention; one bears the inscription "Eugenie Garcia," the other the
immortal name "Marie Malibran." Two familiar portraits adorn the walls:
the pleasant kindly face of the Swedish Nightingale, and the earnest
countenance of Pauline Viardot.

Silvery sounds, full and powerful, reach our ear from the adjoining room;
they attract us irresistibly; we follow them, gently open a side door
and find ourselves in the very sanctum of the master, in the atelier of
the artist. The long folds of the red silk curtains are partially drawn,
so that a rosy light falls upon every object; a fine piano stands in the
middle of the room; arm-chairs by the fireplace; a luxurious divan on one
side covered with scattered music; the elegant marble table loaded with
books, portfolios, music-books, papers of all kinds; music-stands in every
direction, on one of which, beside the singer, we see an open volume of
exercises. "L'école de Garcia, l'art du chant." A breath of poetry seems
to pervade the apartment. Garcia sits at the piano, his scholar stands at
some distance before him.

The maestro is very tall, unusually slender, and of a truly feverish
vivacity. His face is small and deadly pale; his dark, slightly curled
hair falls over a high forehead. His eyes are dark, restless, flashing,
and inspired. Now he listens with fixed attention to the full, swelling
notes that flow from the lips of the songstress; the next he throws back
his head impatiently; a word of warning or of blame is rapidly addressed
to the pupil; sometimes a kindly smile, a slight sarcasm, a pleasant jest,
all strangely intermingled with sudden starts, angry stamping of the feet,
and stern frowns of displeasure. How rarely a word of praise! But one
single warm word of commendation from such a master is a sunbeam that has
power to penetrate and unfold every fast closed bud of zeal and earnest
effort.

How cautiously Garcia handles the precious possession intrusted to his
care, the human voice! How tenderly he protects it! how carefully he
watches it! how anxiously he strives to preserve that pure, brilliant
freshness of youth which is the greatest charm a voice can possess.

It is really impossible to lose this flower-like bloom under Garcia's
guidance; whatever may be said or has already been said to the contrary,
such a reproach can never come home to a master whose whole method is so
entirely according to nature. And how strenuously does he insist upon
resting pauses in his hours of instruction! Hear what he says to that
listening pupil who looks up to him with such eager expectation:--

"Freshness and spontaneousness are the most precious qualities of the
voice, but they are also the most fragile. The voice which loses them
never regains them; its tone is gone, never to return."

"During the first days of practising, the pupils should not devote
themselves to their exercises more than five minutes consecutively; but
studies thus regulated may be resumed four or five times a day, provided
they be separated by long intervals. Afterwards, the time devoted to
practice, by increasing it five minutes at a time, may be extended to half
an hour, a limit which should never be exceeded. At the end of five or six
months, you may increase the number of half hours of exercise to four, but
be careful in going beyond it, remembering always that these periods be
separated by long rests."

The singer begins again. Her own figure stands before her in the large
mirror that hangs behind the master's back; no movement of her face can
escape her; every contraction of her eyebrows, every slight wrinkle in her
forehead, every ungraceful movement of her mouth is truly reflected there.
And no trick passes unreproved, for Garcia's piercing eye watches with
fixed attention every feature of the singer. But he does not arrange and
prescribe how the cheekbones are to move, or the lips to open; he does not
confuse the ideas of his pupils by incomprehensible, wordy descriptions of
the position of the mouth and the posture of the head; he simply repeats
the teaching of the famous old Italian singing-masters, Tosi and Mancini:
"Every singer should hold his mouth as he is in the habit of doing when
he smiles naturally, that is, so that the upper teeth may be moderately
and perpendicularly separated from the lower ones." Without directing
the posture of the body like a drill-sergeant, Garcia says briefly, but
decidedly: "Keep the body erect, tranquil, well-balanced on the two limbs,
and at a distance from any other point of support." The arms must be held
a little back, "so as not to interfere with the play of the chest." The
lesson is finished. The maestro kindly dismisses his pupil, again repeats,
with condensed brevity, the main point of to-day's instruction, appoints
the task for home practice, and encourages the timid departing scholar
with heart-cheering words of courage and hope.

But look! scarcely has the door closed when it is again opened. A pale
young man, accompanied by some sober-looking, elderly gentlemen, bows
in an awkward and yet assuming manner, and, with a smile of conscious
self-satisfaction, presents different letters of recommendation, among
which such names as Meyerbeer, Auber, Spontini, shine out. It is a
singer from one of the provinces; enchanted with the praises of his
table-companions, he is about to devote himself to the stage. His rich
father and richer uncle have come with him to Paris; Cousin Meyerbeer
sends him to Garcia, as he has already sent him from Pontius Auber to
Pilate Spontini. With what indifference Garcia throws aside these great
letters, but how carefully he begins to test the young man's abilities!
The aspiring devotee to art has brought with him his favorite air, his
show-piece; Verdi is his idol among composers! The recitation begins;
Garcia accompanies him. The voice is weak and yet sharp, already
half-cracked; the flow of it unnatural and cramped; the most terrible
effort is apparent at every note; false respiration too, and indistinct
pronunciation. The master grows more and more impatient; his feet begin
to jerk as if seized with sudden cramps; he plays faster and faster; with
feverish haste, his slender hands run over the keys, his face changing
with every sound; his eyes flash more and more restlessly; his teeth are
pressed against his lips; suddenly, he springs from his seat, with the
half-smothered exclamation, "Assez, Monsieur, assez, je vous prie!" He
sinks exhausted into a chair; an awful pause ensues. At last the master
quietly and decidedly explains to the singer the grounds upon which he
is obliged to refuse his request, in spite of all the recommendations
of Meyerbeer and Spontini. His candor and calmness towards the offended
amateur are worthy of admiration. He concludes by kindly advising the
astonished aspirant, if he has not implicit faith in his words, to seek
another teacher, and dismisses the deluded worshipper of Verdi with the
most refined courtesy.

How frequently does he reject lady pupils who, with great assumption and
half-ruined voices, come to him that his hand may scatter a few flowers
over their remains! How impatient he is of all musical narrowness, want
of talent, and laziness! His severity in such cases has given him a bad
reputation, his violence has forced tears from many eyes; but his justice
remains unimpeachable. He will not for a moment feign for a scholar an
interest he does not feel, or that has been forfeited by any of the
defects I have mentioned; he is unsparing in making them feel how little
he cares for such pupils. Holding a book in one hand, with the other he
carelessly strikes an accompaniment, and as he diligently reads on, only
the monotonous "encore" at the end of a solfeggia proves that the ear of
the master has been attending.

The more untrained and untutored the voice that is brought to him, the
more thankfully he receives it. How joyfully does he then devote himself
to his arduous task! how unwearied is his attention! how carefully and
conscientiously does he watch over the treasure intrusted to him! On
the other hand, he is most unwilling to under-take "repairs" and "final
embellishments," which, artist-like, he confesses without disguise; and
singers who, with this in view, seek the master's studio, will have but
little satisfaction in his lessons. * * * * * *

But hush! hush! My gracious protectress gives me a gentle warning, and
touches the magic veil we had wrapped about us. Let us obey her timely
hint, nor provoke one kind spirit to anger! Farewell, good master Garcia!
Heartily do we rejoice that we have listened to thee; believe me, we shall
often wing our way back to thee without fairy help, even in the spirit,
that we may look on thee with gratitude and admiration. And the golden
and silvery sounds which thy magic power draws from young rosy lips will
again flow forth and bear us on in their clear stream; the bright, pearly
drops of brilliant roulades will refresh and quicken us into new life; and
oh, joy! the poor troubled heart will hear no more the sharp, cutting,
irreconcilable discords of the everyday world.

AN AMERICAN ARTISTE ABROAD.--Miss Adelaide Phillips, of Boston, has
lately made a very successful _débût_ at Brescia (Italy), in the
character of _Arsace_ in Rossini's _Semiramide_. "The public were lavish
of well-merited applause," says the Italian critic. Miss Phillips first
sang, as a child, at the Boston Museum. She went, about two years since,
to Italy, to complete her musical education. Biscaccianti sang for her
benefit, and Jenny Lind, though she refused to sing for her, it is
understood, gave her $1,000, and letters of recommendation to her old
teacher, Garcia. Miss Phillips is the fifth American who has, within the
last few years, succeeded on the Italian stage.

TRUE HAPPINESS IN A PALACE.--Frederick William III., King of Prussia,
married, in 1793, Louisa, daughter of the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.
The union was one of elevated love and perfect confidence, the character
of the wife presenting a combination of excellencies that dignify her sex
and ennoble humanity. Among her graces, that of doing good to the poor was
always in exercise. The king allowed her a certain sum for her charities,
which she often exceeded, and when the treasurer informed the king of
this, he had a way of gradually replenishing the drawer in her desk.

She would say, "What angel has filled that drawer for me again?" To which
the king--that the angels were legion, although he knew only _one_; and
then repeated the beautiful verse--

    "He gives his favors to his favorites while sleeping."

This high and tender appreciation of the queen's graces and virtues
appeared at all times. Himself grave, often morose, silent, and somewhat
sarcastic, he knew well how to make use of and shelter himself behind the
serene smiles and ever-genial, gracious demeanor of the queen, to whom
he used to say, when assailed by the plaudits of their subjects: "Now,
Louisa, you must salute them for me; you can do it better than I; but how
you can hold out so long, I cannot think."

Much is said of her sly playfulness and ready repartee, one anecdote of
which we cannot resist giving. The king, who was extremely careful and
judicious in his expenditure, and whose maxim it was that the secret of
dollars lies in _groschen_--exactly similar to our saying about pennies
and pounds--on entering the queen's apartments one morning, espied a
pretty new headdress, of which he jestingly inquired the price.

The queen replied in the same tone: "It is not always right that men
should know the price of women's dress; they don't understand it, and
think everything too dear."

"Well, but do tell me the price for this cap, for I should like to know."

"Oh, certainly I will! I bought it a great bargain; I only gave four
dollars for it."

"Only! an enormous price for such a thing. What a large sum of money!" and
running on in the same vein, he saw from the window an old invalid veteran
of the guard, whom he beckoned to come in, saying to him as he entered:
"The lady who is sitting on that sofa has a great deal of money; now, what
ought she pay for that little cap on the table? You must not be dazzled by
the beautiful pink ribbons, but say what you think it is worth."

The old soldier shrugged his shoulders, and said, after a pause: "Why, I
suppose it would cost some _groschen_" (pence).

"There, now!" said the king; "do you hear that? _Groschen_, indeed! That
thing cost four dollars. Now go and ask that pretty lady for four dollars.
She can well afford to give you as much as she can afford to pay for
_that_."

The queen smilingly opened her purse, and presented the four dollars to
the old man. "And now," continued the queen, archly imitating the king's
tone, "you see that noble gentleman standing at the window; he has much
more money than I have. All I have is from him, and he gives very freely.
Now go and ask for double of what you have got from me: he can afford to
give you eight dollars."

The king saw at once that he was caught in his own trap, and laughingly
gave the old man the sum she had so charmingly forced from him.

Such domestic happiness is seldom found in a palace; when it is, we see
how it adds to the glory of royalty. Every married pair are royal in their
own home, and if every husband and wife would study to make each other
happy, like Frederick and Louisa of Prussia, there would be no question
about the "rights" of either. Both would find their best happiness in
their respective _duties_.

lady editor of the "Book":--

"Mrs. Hale says there is more talent and general information displayed by
the press of the United States, taken collectively, than can be found in
Congress and all the Legislatures taken collectively."

Mrs. Hale never presumed thus to criticize or compare the merits of

himself.

"My blighted Rose-buds," "Come unto me," "To Miss Laura," "Lines," "Two

The following articles are declined: "Valuable Copyrights," "The Grave;"
"The Sabbath of the Soul." (Poetical in idea, and evinces genius as well
as taste; but unequal, and the closing lines poor. The writer may feel
sure of success if energy does not fail.) "Turkish Battle Song," and the
translation of the "Forty-seventh Ode of Anacreon," are both declined.
Neither war nor wine is a fitting theme for our "Book," nor do we need
poetry of any kind. "To Belle Irene." The following, the first and best
stanza, is all we have room for. (There is power in the writer, and he
does not lack imagination, but he dashes off his lines in such hot haste,
that he often leaves metre and measure far behind. A little more care in
the versification would be a great improvement.)

    "I may not love thee, yet within my heart,
      When night and darkness set my spirit free,
    And I am musing from the world apart,
      Soft low requiems murmur words of thee;
    And upward gushing from joy's smouldered fire,
      Shadowlessly, in fresh and tameless glee,
    A wind-wail sweeps through Hope's halcyon lyre,
      Like zephyr's music o'er summer's golden sea."

"Lines about Tecumseh," "To Mary," "I Would;" "Tears." We give below an
extract, the poem being too extended for its one idea; the writer is
capable of better things:--

    "Tears my bleeding heart hath known,
      Tears of sorrow sadly shed,
    Tears I've mingled with thine own,
      Tears while weeping for the dead.
    Tears so brightly let them flow
      Tears from eyes too freely given,
    Tears that none but angels know,
      Tears from kind hearts wildly riven."

"Mrs. Penelope Pennington's Disappointments." (The article is well
written, the subject commonplace.) "A Leaf from the Life of an Old Maid"
was declined; the _acceptance_ noted in September was by mistake; the
"Book" is sent, nevertheless, as the author will undoubtedly succeed, and
we can wait. Many articles on hand are not yet examined.

A NEW AND COMPLETE GAZETTEER OF THE UNITED STATES. Giving a full and
comprehensive review of the present condition, industry, and resources
of the American confederacy; embracing, also, important topographical,
statistical, and historical information, from recent and original sources;
together with the results of the census of 1850, and population and
statistics in many cases to 1853. By Thomas Baldwin and J. Thomas, M. D.
The enterprising publishers of this valuable and important work may very
justly feel gratified in being able to present it to the public, and with
equal truth do they claim it to be the most elaborate, comprehensive, and
perfect "Gazetteer" of the United States that has ever issued from the
press. Instead of 800 pages, to which the work was originally restricted,
it has swelled to 1,400 pages, embracing at least 10,000 names of places
not to be found in any other "Gazetteer," together with the appropriate
statistics and information. Neither the hope of profit, nor the pressure
of competition has induced the publishers to present their work before it
was complete, or before all the ample materials furnished by the census of
1850, and other statistics and important facts in the hands of editors,
were "fully digested and arranged." The expense incurred in the production
of this unequalled "Gazetteer," in which, besides the editors and their
assistants, several thousand correspondents in all parts of the United
States were engaged, has consequently been very great, amounting, as we
learn, to more than $30,000.

But, if the publishers have reason to feel gratified in the result of
their labors, we think the American public should be congratulated in
having within command and ready for use a volume which presents so
faithfully the present condition of the country, in all the ramifications
of population, trade, commerce, wealth, etc., and which foreshadows the
future as unerringly as it records the history of the past. The great
public, therefore, always alive to its own interests, will lose no time
in discovering the propriety, as well as the justice of rewarding the
spirited publishers of the "New and Complete Gazetteer," by purchasing the
volumes as fast as they can be got ready. And this, we think, will be the
result as soon as its merits are generally known. As a book of reference,
it will be indispensable to editors, authors, merchants, and men of
enterprise in all the departments of business. In families, it will also
be found to furnish the readiest means in impressing the young inquirers
with an amount of history in relation to the extent, climate, soil,
productions, and general statistics of their country, which they might
search in vain for in the various histories prepared for their exclusive
benefit.

HAPS AND MISHAPS OF A TOUR IN EUROPE. By Grace Greenwood. This is a very
clever and readable book, its style fluent, flashy, and flowery. Every
sentence is highly wrought and carefully polished, and every sentiment,
good, bad, and indifferent, is expressed in the highest pitch the English
language will bear; and, when it would bear no more, the climax has
sometimes been given in words borrowed from softer, sweeter, or stronger
and more thrilling vocabularies than our coarse mongrel Saxon. We know
Grace Greenwood to be a graceful and polished writer; but in this volume
she has evidently labored too ardently to dignify and garnish poetically
common incidents and common sayings, which would have appeared to much
better advantage in commonplace prose. But all this, we presume, proceeds
from her determination to let her feelings have their full sweep; and
thus, as they have directed her, and as she has been differently impressed
by similar sights and images, we find her at one time subdued and almost
in tears before a painting of the Madonna, and at another hurling
impassioned imprecations upon the heads of those who foster a worse
than pagan superstition. We do not wonder, therefore, after reading her
book, that, near the close of her tour, the over-excited author felt an
inexpressible longing for rest "in a _comfortable_ home among her dear
English friends."

supposed to be more dangerous to those who enter upon it than almost any
other they could make choice of. We see, however, in this instance, as in

revision of the work the author has availed himself of all the new facts
brought to bear upon his subject by the critical observations of friends,
and that the volume now presents a complete history of all the leading
events in the war of the Revolution in South Carolina, dating from the
fall of the city of Charleston, in 1780.

Godey's Arm-Chair.


OUR APRIL NUMBER.--We do not perceive any falling off in the "Lady's
Book." As we commenced, so we go on. We have, at a very considerable
expense, procured the very latest style for bonnets, dresses, and
mantillas, for spring wear. These may be depended upon, as they are not
mere reprints taken from other publications, but designed and engraved
expressly for Godey. We will furnish patterns of the dresses for $1 50,
and of the mantillas for $1.

"THE Trials of a Needlewoman" continues to increase in interest. Our
exchanges and private letters pronounce this Mr. Arthur's best story.

       *       *       *       *       *

BY the way, for the last ten or fifteen years, we have considered Godey's
Fashions unrivalled. No other magazine equals him in this particular. So
says the "Illinois Union," and so says almost every one of our exchanges.
It is useless to enlarge upon this subject. It is conceded.

THE "Germantown Telegraph," whose editor was also caught with the imported
story--"Marrying through Prudential Motives"--comes out like an honorable
gentleman, as he is, and thus speaks he:--

"JUSTICE, THOUGH THE HEAVENS FALL!--Some two or three weeks ago, we
found in one of our respectable New York exchange papers an excellent
story, purporting to have been taken from 'La Belle Assemblée;' entitled
'Marrying through Prudential Motives,' which was no doubt much admired by
our readers; but the paternity of which belongs to 'Godey's Lady's Book,'
instead of the Parisian journal, which, it appears, had unhandsomely
appropriated the production without any acknowledgment of the original
ownership. Coming back to us with a French godfather, of course, it was
a thousand times better than the domestic article, and therefore it
'took' surprisingly. Our own apology is, not that we ever deny our friend
Godey any of the merit that belongs to his elegant and popular magazine,
but simply that the story in question was overlooked at the time of its
publication, in the multiplicity of good things always filling its pages,
and that when it was published in our own columns, it came under our eye
for the first time at the opportune moment. Our desire is at all times to
do 'justice though the heavens fall;' and to none would we yield it more
promptly than the gentlemanly proprietor of the 'Lady's Book.'"

WHITE'S BONNET ESTABLISHMENT IN SECOND ABOVE CHESTNUT STREET.--Mr. White
has got into his new building, and we unhesitatingly pronounce it one of
the handsomest fronts in the city. It is of brown stone of the finest
quality, and is now the palace of the longest business street probably in
the world. Second Street is about five miles long, and if one side of the
street was placed at the end of the other, it would make a straight line
of ten miles of stores.

       *       *       *       *       *

THE "Georgia Times" has caught us. We certainly must plead guilty to his
charge:--

"Godey is up to the highest notch, and seems determined that none shall
outstrip him. Our junior has just given us an idea. Oh, we've got you,
Uncle Louis--caught you in a mistake one time! You said there should be no
'difference between your January and February numbers:' and there is, for
the February number is the better! Now then, sir, ain't you caught?"

       *       *       *       *       *

A PROPER ACKNOWLEDGMENT.--We find in the New York journals copies of
a correspondence between W. C. Bryant, Gulian C. Verplank, Jonathan
Sturges, F. W. Edmonds, A. B. Durand, and other eminent citizens, as a
committee, and Abraham M. Cozzens, Esq., President of the American Art
Union, on the occasion of presenting a service of plate to the latter, as
a testimony on the part of the donors of their "appreciation of his long
and faithful services to the cause of Art in the United States." We can
add our own assurance to that of the committee--for circumstances have
made us familiar with the fact--that, "for a series of years," Mr. Cozzens
has "devoted both time and labor, at a great sacrifice of his personal
interests, to the promotion of a taste for the Fine Arts among his
countrymen, and to the encouragement of native artists," and we cordially
agree with them that his "distinguished services render him worthy of this
tribute"--the tribute being a complete and costly dinner set of massive
silver. We may add, moreover, that besides his special merits as a patron
and promoter of Art, Mr. Cozzens is a fine, frank, generous, right-minded,
true-hearted gentleman, who wins his honors fairly, and knows how to wear
them gracefully.

BURTON has produced "Shakspeare's Midsummer's Night Dream" in most
splendid style at his theatre in New York, and Marshall has brought it
out at the Bowery. Opinions seem to differ among the New York press as to

FRENCH FURNITURE.--The furniture which is now made in the ateliers of
Paris is unparalleled in magnificence and extravagance. Bedroom, as well
as drawing-room furniture, is laden with sculpturing and ornaments.
Gilt furniture is much in vogue for drawing-rooms; the rich brocatelles
and damasks produce a beautiful effect in the gilt frames. The superb
furniture of the state-rooms of the Tuileries is of gilt; when illuminated
by a thousand wax lights, the effect is gorgeous. This style of furniture
is only suitable for large reception-rooms.

THE following is dreadfully touching, and what is more, it is pointed. It
cannot possibly affect any of our subscribers, however, for there is not
one of them but would scorn the implication of being a delinquent to the
"Lady's Book." We need hardly say that it is an imitation of Hood's "Song
of the Shirt":--

              "Toil, toil, toil!
    As the constant drop on a stone,
      So this ceaseless, endless work,
    Wears away body and bone!
      Though the Poet sputter and write,
    Though the Orator bully and bawl,
      If it were not for the Editor's pen,
    What were the use of it all?

              Toil, toil, toil,
    Christians, Mormons, and Jews:
      Is there a man on this weary earth
    But grows richer by reading the news?
      Richer, richer, richer,
    As they read it by sunlight and taper?
      And yet there isn't a soul of them all
    But grudges to pay for his paper!"

THE INSTRUCTIVE CHARACTER OF THE LADY'S BOOK.--This is the point that we
wish to urge upon the public; that every number is full of instruction
as well as amusement. Several of our exchanges have commented upon this
matter. Our title would seem to mislead--and why it should, it is hard to
tell. We would not publish a book for a lady, and pay so poor a compliment
to her understanding as to fill it with mere trifling matter. We aim at
nobler purposes, and we challenge an investigation and a comparison with
any magazine, as to which contains the most instructive matter, either
to a lady or gentleman. Look at our descriptions of Factories of various
kinds; our Model Cottages; our receipts upon every subject; our essays;
our practical instructions to every lady how to cut and make her own
dresses; the various kinds of needlework for ladies; our accounts of the
several gold regions, Nineveh, Babylon, &c. The editor of the "Ithaca
Chronicle" says: "We have just received the January No., for 1854, and
can truly say it is more welcome to our table than any other magazine we
now receive. The present number contains one hundred pages of reading
matter--not flimsy trash--but of such as is instructive to any person who
will read it with a desire to gain knowledge."

YOUNG HYSON AND POTATOES.--The "Stroudsburg Jeffersonian" says: "Our
wife would rather go without her Young Hyson at any time (and she is
passionately fond of it too), than miss the smiles of Godey; or a new
dress, rather than to be without his patterns for making it." The
"Christian Advocate" of Missouri expresses his astonishment that we are
acquainted with the virtue of the potato:--

"Mr. Godey, at the back of his ARM-CHAIR, gives a list of excellent
receipts for cooking potatoes. From the nice and superb manner in which he
has always gotten out his book for the ladies, we had no certain evidence
that he had much acquaintance with that invaluable _esculent_, the potato.
It seems, however, we were mistaken. Success to him."

Not acquainted with potatoes! Why, my dear sir, it is the A B C of
cooking, and is the first thing to be learned; besides, as a caterer for
the ladies, we are bound to know a little of everything.

       *       *       *       *       *

THE NEW MANTEAU DE LA COUR, required to be worn by the ladies at the
French court, is even more unpopular than was anticipated. Husbands
don't like it on account of the expense, and wives shrink from the
dancing-master's drill, without which, the wearers of the costume cannot
hope to avoid appearing ridiculous. The Empress alone has train-bearers;
but other ladies must concentrate all the powers of their mind upon their
trains to escape a catastrophe. At the last reception-night there were not
more than two hundred ladies present out of eight hundred invited. Under
these circumstances it is thought impossible to enforce the regulation
announced, that ladies not availing themselves of invitations on January
the first, would not be again asked to court during the year.

VERY neat and pretty compliment from the "North Carolina Whig and
Advocate":--

"Godey is always prompt, always welcome, and always interesting. If we
were asked to point out the best number of the 'Lady's Book,' we should
reply in the language of Dr. Johnson when asked which of Shakspeare's
plays he most admired? 'The last I read,' the Doctor answered."

THERE has been some pleasantry on the part of the press touching that
unfortunate milkmaid in our February number being on the wrong side of the
cow. Our answer is very plain, and gentlemen should make inquiry before
they criticize. The girl was _left-handed_, and the cow would not be
milked on the other side. She was--that is the cow--a queer creature.

DEDICATORY ADDRESS, delivered before the members of Hesperian Lodge,
upon the opening of their new hall, by Anson G. Chester, of the "Morning
Express." In as short a notice as our space will permit us to give, we
cannot do justice to the merits of this beautiful address. We could only
do so by publishing the whole of it. Mr. Chester is well known as one of
the best poets in this country. His prose is poetic, and worthy of its
distinguished author. We wish also to pay a compliment to the handsome
dress in which the pamphlet is presented to the public. Messrs. A. M.
Clapp & Co. may well be proud of it. The cover is the prettiest piece of
type-work we have seen in a long time.

FRANKLIN INSTITUTE REPORT of the twenty-third exhibition. The address, by

THE "Charleston Weekly News" says of Mrs. Hale's "New Book of Cookery,"
and the "New Household Receipt Book":--

"These two works will prove invaluable to housekeepers. Mrs. Hale has
absolutely exhausted her subject. There is nothing in the wide world, we
believe, appertaining to the '_cuisine_,' from the homeliest to the most
_recherché_ dishes, receipts for the preparation of which cannot be found
in these volumes. We think that all the ladies who have the direction of
'a home department,' should send a vote of thanks to the author of this
Encyclopædia of what should certainly be ranked among the fine arts."

We can furnish one or both.

THE "Boston Olive Branch" comes to us in a new dress, and looks very
handsome. It is an excellent paper, and well conducted. Its circulation
is very large. Mr. Norris, the publisher, has authority from us to club
his paper with the "Lady's Book." We wish also to say a word of another
excellent paper published in another part of our Union, the "Georgia
Citizen," L. F. W. Andrews, editor and publisher. There is no paper we
open with more satisfaction. It is sprightly and solid. Mr. Andrews, its
editor, is a man of sterling sense and honesty. We know him well, and
esteem him highly. Our merchants would do well to select it for their

BEDCHAMBER OF THE EMPRESS EUGENIE OF FRANCE.--The upholsterers have
furnished it a magnificent sky-blue silk _tenture_ along the walls, which
is fixed by gold frames, in the style of Louis XV. The arm-chairs, chairs,
sofas, and lounges are of the same style and like silk. As for the bed,
all made with gilt carved wood, it is covered with a _couvre pieds_ of
Maline lace, and the curtains, of blue silk and lace, are hung down all
around it, in the same manner as the old beds of our grandmothers. The
carpet is also of a blue color, and so thick that one would take it for
a bear skin. It was made at Aubusson, expressly for the place in which
it lays. The ceiling of the room was painted by Mr. Bresson, and it
represents a group of geniuses throwing flowers from rich baskets. The
painting is so well done that no one could believe that the figures are
not alive. In short, this magnificent bedroom is the _ne plus ultra_ of
riches and elegance.

Well, this is all well enough in its way; but who would not prefer being
plain Mrs. Smith or Mrs. Godey, or any other Mrs.--never being certain,
for a moment, when your husband goes out, that he is not to be shot at.
Even if you want to go and pay a friendly visit only one or two squares
off, you must wait until six horses are harnessed up, a body of cavalry
dressed and mounted, the streets cleared of the crowd, and a host of other
little etceteras. Dear me, we should soon be tired of royalty!

FEMALE SHOEMAKERS.--It is stated that in Washington some of the most
respectable women, married and single, engage in the shoemaking business
as an agreeable pastime, as well as from motives of economy. "The gaiters
which cost us three dollars at the stores," writes a female, "cost us one
day's labor and sixty cents for the best material bought at retail. One of
us has made five pair of ladies' gaiters in a week. Many of us make shoes
for ourselves and children, without neglecting other household duties. On
Capitol Hill, alone, there are thirty ladies thus employed, and about two
hundred in the city. We find it very easy to make two pair of children's
shoes in a day, and they cost here one dollar and twenty-five cents a
pair."

We understand that many ladies in this city stitch and prepare their own
gaiter boots, and have them made up by the shoemaker. Others again find
out the journeymen and employ them. We understand that at least one to one
and a half dollars are thus saved on one pair of boots.

Yes, my dear madam, we are married. Sorry to disappoint the Western
ladies; but we have a son fast growing up to man's estate. He will be in

Betty brought up the shells after dinner--a large tray full of them.
"Why, what have you there, Betty?" "The shells, ma'am; and they are quite
hot." "Shells!" exclaimed the indignant mistress. "Why, those are oyster
shells!" "Sure they are, ma'am; and, as you had oysters last night, and I
didn't see any other shells, I thought it was these you wanted warmed."

WE extract the following from Mrs. Partington's "Carpet Bag of Fun":--


A STRING OF EPITAPHS.

    "WEEP, stranger, for a father spilled
    From a stage-coach, and thereby killed:
    His name was John Sykes, a maker of sassengers,
    Slain with three other outside passengers."

    "Here lies the body of James Monk,
    Suddenly drowned when he was drunk;
    He paid his score, and cheated no man--
    _De mortius nil nisi bonum_."

    "_His jacet_, Tom and Titus Tressel,
    Lost by the swamping of their vessel.
    A leak she sprung and settled fast;
    Payment of Nature's debt was asked,
    And it was paid--the debtors failing
    To give security by bailing.
    Full many a storm they nobly braved,
    And tho' they're lost, we hope they're saved."

MRS. PARTINGTON ON FUNNY-GRAPHY.--And Ike read, "Mr. Wightman submitted a
detailed report on the subject of introducing phonotopy, as a study, into
the primary schools." "Stop, Isaac," said Mrs. Partington, threateningly
holding up her finger, and slightly frowning, "don't make light of
anything serious that you are reading--it isn't pretty." "But it's so in
the paper, aunt," said Ike; and he again read the sentence, emphasizing
the word "_phonotopy_" prodigiously. Mrs. Partington adjusted her specs,
and looked at it, letter by letter, to be assured. "Well, if ever!" said
she, holding up her hands; "I declare I don't know what they're gwine to
do next. They're always organizing or piano-fortin the schools, and now
this funny topy comes along to make 'em laugh, I s'pose, when they ought
to be getting their lessons. Sich levity is offal. They do have sich queer
notions, nowadays! I can't make head nor tail of 'em, I'm shore."

CONCERT HALL, PHILADELPHIA.--We beg leave to recommend this splendid room
to all who wish to occupy it for exhibitions of any kind, concerts, balls,
lectures, &c. Mr. Andrews, the lessee, is very attentive, and he is ably
seconded by his right-hand man, Mr. Hood. In fact, politeness to visitors
by all concerned seems to be the ruling feature.

THE EYELASHES AND EYEBROWS.--In Circassia, Georgia, Persia, and India, one
of the mother's earliest cares is to promote the growth of her children's
eyelashes by tipping and removing the fine gossamer-like points with a
pair of scissors, when they are asleep. By repeating this every month or
six weeks, they become, in time, long, close, finely curved, and of a
silky gloss. The practice never fails to produce the desired effect, and
it is particularly useful when, owing to inflammation of the eyes, the
lashes have been thinned or stunted.

LA PIERRE HOUSE.--The Boston "Olive Branch" says of this magnificent
hotel:--

"'_La Pierre House._' Such is the name of a new hotel just opened in
Philadelphia, of the most magnificent character. As described in the
'Inquirer,' we should deem it to surpass, in finish and in splendor of
furnishment, the regal glory of a palace. Hear how it describes one of
the suite of rooms: 'It consists of a parlor and chamber, is extremely
beautiful, and furnished in the very richest possible manner, yet with
a quietness and repose of taste that are very pleasing and striking.
The rooms are separated by a rose-colored and white brocatelle curtain,
intertwined with a graceful drapery of lace, suspended from a golden arch.
The bedstead is of the richest carving in rosewood, exquisitely adorned
with rose and lace drapery, pendent from an ornamental canopy above.'"

A CIRCUMSTANCE of this kind could only happen in Paris, and we somewhat
doubt that it ever occurred there:--

On Thursday, a beautiful equipage was seen in the Champs Elysées,
containing an elderly gentleman and a lady; the latter, though her face
was covered with a thick veil, appeared to be young and handsome. The
gentleman, an Englishman, Sir Edward ----, is said to be one of the oddest
and most eccentric fellows ever produced by prolific Albion. A talented
pianist was lately summoned to his house. His services were required for
an evening party, and a generous recompense was promised. The musician
came early, and he was introduced into a spacious drawing-room, where many
persons were already assembled. This apartment, which was magnificently
furnished, was but dimly lighted by two lamps, and scarcely heated at
all--the splendid fireplace, adorned with costly bronzes, containing
only a wretched fire, which cast a sepulchral glare over the rich
furniture. The host went to meet the musician as soon as the footman had
announced him, and received him in a most flattering manner. A lady, most
sumptuously and elegantly dressed, was seated on a sofa. "Allow me to
introduce you to Lady ----, my wife!" said Sir Edward. The musician made a
profound obeisance, which the lady, nevertheless, took no notice of; she
sat straight and immovable, and fixed an unearthly gaze on the new-comer.
There was another lady in an arm-chair, leaning with her elbow on a round
table, and apparently reading a book with the greatest attention. "My
sister, Miss Emily," said Sir Edward. "Mademoiselle," said the pianist,
with a bow; but in vain did he repeat the word and the salutation to call
the attention of the young lady; she neither moved nor raised her eyes
from the book. "She has always loved reading very much," said Sir Edward.
"Rather more than politeness would warrant!" thought the _artiste_ to
himself. The remainder of the company consisted of five or six gentlemen.
The _artiste_ observed, with astonishment, that all these persons affected
a strange immobility, just like the lady and sister of Sir Edward. "Will
you take a seat at the piano?" said Sir Edward. "What do you wish me to
play?" asked the musician. "Shall I select the pieces, or will madam have
the kindness to point out some favorite _morceau_?" Miladi did not reply,
and Sir Edward, answering for her, said, "My wife and I have the same
taste in music, so play a piece of Mozart or Listz, and one of your own
compositions." "I will begin my own, therefore; for after those masters
mine would not be acceptable!" modestly replied the _artiste_. The sofa
on which Miladi was seated was very near the piano, and placed in such
a manner that the _artiste_ had the lady opposite him. He looked at her
while he was playing, in order to read in her countenance the impression
which the music might produce on her. The handkerchief which Miladi held
in her hand, having, after a while, fallen to the ground, the musician
rushed forward to pick it up: and, in doing so, could not refrain from
uttering an exclamation of surprise. "What is the matter with you?" said
Sir Edward. "Oh, sir, the lady--the pretended lady!" "Alas!" interrupted
Sir Edward, "I only possess the image of an adored wife!" And it was then
explained that the worthy baronet, being inconsolable for the loss of
certain friends, always travelled about with their image in wax! A party
of _living_ friends afterwards assembled, and the evening was spent very
agreeably.

HOUSEKEEPERS, look at this; and, before you engage a cook, inquire if she
has a husband. This is an illustration of that that said husband going to
the paternal abode, with something to feed the young ravens, after having
paid a visit to his wife. It is simply "the husband of your cook leaving
your house."

SOUND REASONING--and, as such, will be recognized by those who have been
humbugged by the Brown and other lecturers who have honored us with visits
from abroad:--

_Lectures_ vs. _Books_.--Why a man should put on his overcoat and
comforter, and a woman wrap herself in furs, mufflers, cloaks, and shawls,
and the children bundle up, to face a strong nor'-wester, and go out to
hear a lecture of dubious excellence, or a concert that, after all, is
little better than a bore, while at home a goodly array of philosophers
and poets, story-tellers and grand advisers, stand waiting to offer their
services; yet not one of which looks sad if his neighbor is preferred
before him--this we would wonder at, if it were not everybody's habit.
If a man has weak eyes, or his thoughts find no anchorage, and if he
cannot afford the luxury of a private reader, let him visit the public
lecture-room, and he can get much good from it. Or if, for his sins, he
has lost his home, let him go to the concert and mortify himself. But we
who have homes cannot afford, first, the sacrifice of our home comforts,
second, the loss of precious winter evening hours, and third, the price
of tickets, unless we know of a surety that they will admit us to choice
performances.

SINGULAR INSCRIPTIONS ON TOMBSTONES.

On the Duke of Marlborough:--

    Here lies John, Duke of Marlborough
    Who run the French through and through;
    He married Sarah Jennings, spinster,
    Died at Windsor, and was buried at Westminster.

In St. Bennet's, Paul's Wharf, London:--

    Here lies one _More_, and no more than he:
    One _More_ and no _More!_ how can that be?
    Why one _More_, and no more, may well lie here alone,
    But here lies one _More_, and that is more than one!

From Broom Churchyard, England:--

        God be praised!
    Here is Mr. Dudley, senior,
      And Jane, his wife, also,
    Who, while living, was his superior;
      But see what death can do.
    Two of his sons also lie here,
      One Walter, t'other Joe;
    They all of them went in the year 1510 below.

In St. Michael's Churchyard, Aberystwith, is another, to the memory of
David Davies, blacksmith:--

    My sledge and hammer lay reclined,
    My bellows, too, have lost their wind,
    My fire's extinct, my forge decayed,
    And in the dust my vice is laid;
    My coal is spent, my iron gone,
    My nails are driven--my work is done.

The following epitaph is transcribed from one of the local histories of
Cornwall:--

    Father and mother and I,
      Lies buried here as under,
    Father and mother lies buried here,
      And I lies buried yonder.

is yet to be seen, in Latin, over the tomb of Dr. Samuel Rutter, formerly
prebendary of Litchfield, and afterwards Bishop of Sodor and Man:--

SOME FEW INSTRUCTIONS IN CROCHET-WORK, which may be of use to some of our
lady readers.

In the first instance, the crochet-hook should be very smooth, made of
fine steel, and fixed in handles. The stitches used are _chain_, _slip_,
_single_, _double_, _treble_, and _long treble crochet_.

_Chain Stitch_ (ch) is made by forming a loop on the thread, then
inserting the hook, and drawing the thread through the loop already made.
Continue this, forming a succession of stitches.

_Slip Stitch_ is made by drawing a thread _at once_ through any given
stitch and the loop on the needle.

_Single Crochet_ (sc). Having a loop on the needle, insert the hook in a
stitch and draw the thread through in a loop. You have then two on the
hook; draw the thread through both at once.

_Double Crochet_ (dc). Twist the thread round the hook before inserting
it in the stitch, through which you draw the thread in a loop. There will
then be three loops on the hook; draw the thread through two, and then
through the one just formed and the remaining one.

_Treble Crochet_ (tc), and _Long Treble_ (long tc), are worked in the same
way; in treble the thread is put _twice_, in long treble _three times_,
before inserting it into the stitch.

_Square Crochet_ is also sometimes used. The squares are either open or
close. An open square consists of one dc, two ch, missing two on the line
beneath before making the next stitch. A close square has three successive
dc. Thus any given number of close squares, followed by an open, will
have so many times three dc, and _one over_; therefore any foundation for
square crochet must have a number that can be divided by three, having one
over.

_To contract an Edge._ This may be done in dc, tc, or long tc. Twist the
thread round the hook as often as required, insert it in the work, and
half do a stitch. Instead of finishing it, twist the thread round again,
until the same number of loops are on, and work a stitch entirely; so
that, for two stitches, there is only one head.

_To join on a Thread._ In joining, finish the stitch by drawing the new
thread through, leaving two inches for both ends, which must be held in.

_To use several Colors._ This is done in single crochet. Hold the threads
not in use on the edge of the work, and work them in. Change the color
by beginning the stitch in the old color and finishing it with the new,
continuing the work with the latter holding in the old. If only one stitch
is wanted in the new color, finish one stitch and begin the next with it;
then change.

_To "Purl" in Netting._ Bring your thread forward, and take up the inner
side of the stitch, putting your needle downwards in the stitch instead of
upwards, as you do in plain knitting.

"Graduate" is informed that he had better advertise in the papers here for
the situation he wants. There is no other way of procuring it. We have
used the masculine in answering this, as "Graduate" omits letting us know
whether we are addressed by a male or female. If a female, why not write
the first name in full, or prefix Mrs. or Miss?

"SIR: I have endeavored to be as punctual as possible in making up my

necessary to our happiness. I am gratified that there are a few ladies
among us who are sufficiently endowed with a sense of the beautiful and

it bears acquaintance well. That race of beings who borrow everything

CHEAP CONTRIVANCE FOR FILTERING.--A very cheap and good contrivance for
filtering is to take a large garden flower-pot, and lay in the bottom a
piece of sponge, so as to cover the hole. Upon this put a few smooth,
clean pebbles, to keep the sponge in its place, and fill up the pot, to
within two or three inches of the brim, with a mixture of one part of
powdered charcoal to two parts of fine sharp sand. Then cover the top
of the pot with a piece of clean white flannel, tied tightly round the
rim with a twine, but so as to sink or sway down in the centre. Set the
flower-pot in a pan or tub, and pour the water into the flannel, letting
it filter through the charcoal, &c.; and, by the time it has passed
through the sponge, and come out at the bottom, it will be clear.

TO CLEANSE A TEAKETTLE FROM FUR.--Heat the kettle rapidly over a fire of
shavings, having previously made it quite dry. The expansion will separate
the fur from the metal, and it may then be easily removed.

       *       *       *       *       *

TO REMOVE STAINS OF ACIDS, &C.--Stains caused by acids may be removed
by tying some pearlash up in the stained part; scrape some soap in soft
cold water, and boil the linen till the stain is gone. Many stains may be
removed by dipping the linen in some sour buttermilk, and drying it in a
hot sun, washing it afterwards in cold water. It may be found necessary to
repeat this once or twice.

       *       *       *       *       *

TO TAKE OUT IRONMOULD.--Wet the ironmould with water, and then lay the
linen on a hot water-plate and put on the part a little essential salt of
lemons. When it becomes dry, wet it again, and renew the process, being
particular that the plate is boiling hot. Dip the linen into a good deal
of water, and wash it as soon as the stain is removed, to prevent any
damage from the acid.

       *       *       *       *       *

TO PRESERVE STEEL PENS.--Metallic pens may be preserved from rusting by
throwing into the bottle containing the ink a few nails, or broken pieces
of steel pens, if not varnished. The corrosive action of the acid which
the ink contains is expended on the iron so introduced, and will not
therefore affect the pen.

       *       *       *       *       *

FRENCH POLISH.--To one pint of spirits of wine add a quarter of an ounce
of gum copal, a quarter of an ounce of gum arabic, and one ounce of
shellac. Let your gums be well bruised, and sifted through a piece of
muslin. Put the spirits and the gums together in a vessel that can be
safely corked; place them near a warm stove, and frequently shake them.
In two or three days they will be dissolved; strain it through a piece of
muslin, and keep it tightly corked for use.

CHARLOTTE RUSSE. _An easy way._--Mix with the yolks of four eggs a quarter
of a pound of sugar pounded fine, and add to this half a pint of new
milk. Put it over the fire till it begins to thicken like custard, but do
not let it boil; then add half a pint of very stiff calves-foot jelly.
Strain it through a napkin; put in a pan placed on ice, a pint of very
rich cream, flavored or not, as you like, and whip it until it looks like
float; pour the cream into another dish, and put the custard in the pan
on the ice; stir it on the ice with a paddle until it becomes thick like
jelly; then add the cream very lightly. The mixture should look like light
sponge-cake before it is baked. A round tin pan must be prepared with
sponge-cake, called ladies' fingers, placed around and at the bottom very
evenly and closely; pour the charlotte in it, and place it on the ice till
wanted. When wanted, put a round dish or plate on it, and turn it out. The
bottom will then be at the top--and no cake at the bottom.

       *       *       *       *       *

CREAM HASTY.--Take a gallon of milk from the cow, set it on the fire, and
when it begins to rise take it off the fire, skim off all the cream and
put it on a plate, then set the skillet on the fire again and repeat the
skimming till your plate is full of cream; put to it some orange flower
and sugar, and serve it.

       *       *       *       *       *

CREAM "AU NATUREL."--Take some thin cream, mind and let it be fresh, and
put it in a bowl on ice to cool; add to it powdered sugar, and serve it.

       *       *       *       *       *

CREAM, TO KEEP.--Cream already skimmed may be kept twenty-four hours, if
scalded without sugar; and, by adding to it as much powdered lump sugar as
will make it sweet, it will keep good two days in a cool place.

       *       *       *       *       *

CURDS AND CREAM.--With about half a tablespoonful of rennet, turn two
quarts of milk just from the cow; drain off the whey, and fill a mould
with the curd; when it has stood an hour or two, turn it out. Strew
colored comfits over it, sweeten some cream, mix grated nutmeg with it,
and pour it round the curd.

       *       *       *       *       *

CURDS AND CREAM, AS IN SCOTLAND.--Put two quarts of new milk into the dish
in which it is to be served, and turn it with a teaspoonful of rennet;
when the curd has come, serve it with the cream in a separate dish.

       *       *       *       *       *

NAPLES CURD.--Put into a quart of new milk a stick of cinnamon, boil it
a few minutes, take out the cinnamon, and stir in eight well-beaten eggs
and a tablespoonful of white wine; when it boils again, strain it through
a sieve; beat the curd in a basin, together with about half an ounce of
butter, two tablespoonfuls of orange-flower water, and pounded sugar
sufficient to sweeten it. Put it into a mould for two hours before it is
sent to table. White wine, sugar, and cream may be mixed together and
poured round the curd, or it may be served in a sauce tureen.

THE SICK ROOM AND NURSERY.

CURE FOR SQUINTING.--Squinting frequently arises from the unequal strength
of the eyes, the weaker eye being turned away from the object, to avoid
the fatigue of exertion. Cases of squinting of long standing have often
been cured by covering the stronger eye, and thereby compelling the weaker
one to exertion.

       *       *       *       *       *

SCRATCHES.--Trifling as scratches often seem, they ought never to be
neglected, but should be covered and protected, and kept clean and dry
until they have completely healed. If there is the least appearance of
inflammation, no time should be lost in applying a large bread and water
poultice, or hot flannels repeatedly applied, or even leeches in good
numbers may be put on at some distance from each other.




CENTRE-TABLE GOSSIP.


THE HOUSEHOLD.

IT is a long time ago since we rejoiced in the possession of a new
spelling-book, with a bright blue board cover (so liable to get the
corners chipped off), and learned from its fascinating pages that
ever-to-be-remembered lesson for the household--

    "Whatever brawls disturb the street,
    There should be peace at home."

What else of profit we gleaned from its double-columned pages, our
readers, or perhaps our printers, are the best judges; but the poetic bit
of family government, though faded with years, comes out now and then
feebly in remembrance, as sympathetic inks brighten by firelight. It is
at present recalled by a subject suggestive for this month's chat, "the
duties of an elder daughter at home," or, as we would have it read, of
"daughters at home." The mother of a large family has had demands on her
time, health, and spirits in their infancy, which they cannot understand
until they come to be situated in like manner, but certain it is, and as
the daughters grew up around her, she naturally looks to them to aid her
in the cares and responsibilities of the home.

Of course, to all well-ordered governments there must be one head, the
centre of all action; but inferior officers can ofttimes take the whole
burden of petty detail. The silver, the mending, the wash, must be seen
to, and here it might be a daughter's pleasant duty to see her mother's
instructions faithfully obeyed. How much better this, than adding to the
general discomfort and disorderly careless habits, and inconsideration or
rudeness to the servants.

Then as regards her brothers--the daughter of the household has much to
think of: to be considerate for their comfort, to respect their feelings,
to care for their amusement, to enter into their plans and pursuits. How
many a brother is driven to seek idle, expensive, and too often vicious
company from the lack of such sympathy at home! And yet one so often
hears--"brothers are so troublesome"--or, "we can't practice just to play
for a brother"--or, "the boys have their company, and I have mine." The
taste may not always be congenial, but good feeling and gentle manners
will accomplish far more than a sarcastic repulse.

Thus, in course of time, the stepping-stones safely passed, the girl
becomes the young wife--housekeeper--mother--fitted for the duties of her
station, and therefore contented with it, finding nothing harsh or irksome
in domestic routine, and satisfied with the pleasures and enjoyments of
home. Far more likely to do so than she who leads a careless, idle life as
a girl--to become a fretful, discontented wife, or neglectful mother.

    Our Daily Paths! with thorns or flow'rs
      We can at will bestrew them;
    What bliss would gild the passing hours,
      If we but rightly knew them!
    The way of life is rough at best,
      But briers yield the roses,
    So that which leads to joy and rest
      The hardest path discloses.

    The weeds that oft we cast away,
      Their simple beauty scorning,
    Would form a wreath of purest ray
      And prove the best adorning.
    So in our daily paths, 'twere well
      To call each gift a treasure,
    However slight, where love can dwell
      With life-renewing pleasure!

       *       *       *       *       *


LACES AND EMBROIDERIES.

WE promised, in speaking of new caps, a paragraph in our fashion chat on
laces; but, as that has its own material, in discussing the merits of
shapes and styles, we lay our laces upon the centre-table instead.

We have now in preparation some very new and tasteful designs for
chemisettes, to be worn in mourning, every one understanding that
embroideries are laid aside with a black dress. For the strictest styles,
plain linen, cambric, and Swiss muslin are worn; but when silks or fringed
dresses are put on, fluted ruffles, edged with plain narrow lace, on
collars and open sleeves, are not out of taste, or edges of needle-work in
scallops and points.

Laces, or very thin muslin embroidery, will be worn this summer; cambric,
whether plain or embroidered, being seen only in morning-dress. We speak
to those who "dress for dinner." There is a new style of lace, the
Maltese, which is very heavy and apparently durable, somewhat resembling
Honiton, at about half its cost. It is very pretty for caps, as seen in
our design for the month. Heavy laces are still in vogue; Valenciennes and
the still more delicate and lady-like Mechlin have given place to them.
There is an Irish point occasionally to be met with, the most durable
of all, being of the purest linen thread. Collars, or chemisettes, and
undersleeves are worn to match. Nothing is more untidy--save soiled
muslins--than to see cambric sleeves and a rich lace collar, or muslin
sleeves and English flouncing for a chemisette. Better to have both of
plain cambric or linen.

WASHING MADE EASY.

THE truthfulness of the "Washing-Day" song, with its disagreeable effects
on the spirits and temper, has never been questioned or doubted. For
ourselves, our spirits fall with the first rising of steam from the
kitchen, and only reach a natural temperature when the clothes are
neatly folded in the ironing-basket. If any of our club sympathize with
us, they will rejoice that a better day is at hand, and consider the
invention described below as full of the deepest interest to our sex as
housekeepers. The one thus commented on is in use in the St. Nicholas
Hotel, New York:--

"A strong wooden cylinder, four feet diameter, and four and a half feet
long, is mounted on a frame, so as to be driven by a band on one end of
the shaft. This shaft is hollow, with pipes so connected with it that hot
or cold water, or steam, can be introduced at the option of the person
in charge. The cylinder being half full of water, a door at one end is
opened, and 300 to 500 pieces of clothing are thrown in, with a suitable
quantity of soap, and an alkaline fluid which assists in dissolving the
dirt and bleaching the fabric, so that clothes, after being washed in this
manner, increase in whiteness without having the texture injured.

"When the cylinder is changed, it is put in motion by a small
steam-engine, and made to revolve slowly, first one way a few revolutions,
and then the other, by which the clothes are thrown from side to side, in
and out, and through the water. During this operation the steam is let in
through a double-mouthed pipe--somewhat of this shape, X--which has one
mouth in and one mouth out of water; the steam entering the water through
the immersed end, and escaping through the other, by which means it is
made to pass through the clothes, completely cleansing them in fifteen
or twenty minutes. The steam is now cut off, and the hot water drawn
through the waste pipe, and then cold water introduced, which rinses the
articles in a few more turns of the cylinder. They are now suffered to
drain until the operator is ready to take them out, when they are put
into the drying-machine, which runs like a millstone, and its operation
may be understood by supposing that millstone to be a shallow tub, with
wire network sides, against which the clothes being placed, it is put in
rapid motion; the air, passing in a strong current into the top and bottom
of the tub, and out of the sides, carries all the moisture with it into
the outside case, from whence it runs away. The length of time requisite
to dry the clothes depends upon the rapidity of the revolving tub. If it
should run 3,000 revolutions a minute, five to seven minutes would be
quite sufficient. When there is not sufficient steam to run the dryer
with that speed, it requires double that. In washing and drying, there is
nothing to injure the fabric. Ladies' caps and laces are put up in netting
bags, and are not rubbed by hand or machine to chafe or tear them in the
least, but are cleansed most perfectly.

"It can readily be imagined what a long line of wash-tubs would be
required to wash 5,000 pieces a day, and what a big clothes-yard to dry
them in; while here the work is done by four persons, who only occupy
part of a basement-room, the other part being occupied by the mangle, and
ironing and folding-tables. Adjoining are the airing-frames, which are
hung with clothes, and then shoved into a room steam-pipe heated, when
they are completely dried in a few minutes.

"_Small Family Machines._--Almost the first thought, after witnessing
the operation of this machine, was, can washing be done upon the same
principle in small families? To our inquiries upon this point, we have
received the following satisfactory information:--

"For common family use, hand-machines are made to cost from $40 to $50,
with which a woman can wash fifty pieces at a time, and complete 500 in a
day without laboring severely. For the purpose of washing, without driving
the machinery by steam, a very small boiler will be sufficient. It is not
necessary to have a head of water, as that can be found in the cylinder,
which can be turned by horse or any other convenient power. The plan of
cleansing clothes by steam is not a new one; but it is contended by the
inventor that his process is an improvement upon all heretofore applied to
that purpose."

APPLETONS'.

APPLETONS' is the very conspicuous gilt-lettered name of a large
brown-stone building just opened on Broadway, New York, for the business
purposes of this well-known firm. It was built originally for a public
library, but was bought last spring by the present owners, and the lower
story has since been fitted up for them. Henceforth, "Appletons'" will be
one of the lions of Broadway.

It may not be a very flattering comparison, but one at least easily
understood--what "Stewart's" is to the woman of fashion, or "Taylor's" to
the _gourmand_, "Appletons'" is now to the student or the book fancier.
The design and decorations are in perfect keeping with the business, the
very windows, deep set as they are, suggesting the alcoves, with which
it is lined, as in a public library. The ceiling walls are ornamented
in fresco, of quiet, yet cheerful tints; fourteen Corinthian columns
are the central support, and these have the effect of Sienna marble.
The book-cases and shelving are of plain oak. The proportions and whole
interior effect are admirable; and here are to be found everything that is
_bindable_ or readable, from superb London editions of the classics to the
last new school-book, in its plain cloth cover.

A good hour's lounge would scarcely give a just idea of the united
elegance and utility of the new establishment; for the curious visitor
should not neglect to glance at the wholesale ware-room, occupying the
warm, well-lighted basement, which has its own "exits and entrances," its
own salesmen, attendants, and purchasers, and gives perhaps a more just
estimate of the immense business of the firm. There is certainly nothing
approaching to it in this country or in England.

TO CORRESPONDENTS.

WE must enforce upon our correspondents the necessity of being _explicit_
in forwarding their addresses; for we agree with them in thinking it
rather awkward for a young lady to be addressed as M. S. Jones, _Esq._,
or a married lady to find herself suddenly divorced, and written to as
_Miss_. But how are we to help it? How is the editor, especially in the
haste and confusion of a correspondence the uninitiated cannot imagine
or comprehend, to discover from internal evidence whether the said M. S.
Jones is a noun masculine or feminine, or, being feminine, to decide upon
her state and condition regarding the holy bonds of matrimony? Let the
letter read thus, and all doubt and misdirection are at an end:--

    "DEAR SIR: Inclosed is $10 for the following subscription to the
    Lady's Book.

        MISS M. S. JONES,
        _Dalton, Ohio_"--

or Mrs., as the prefix may be. That agreeable young lady will not, in this
case, have her feelings hurt by being addressed as Esq., and so supposed
to belong to the Woman's Right party, at least; nor we be obliged to
waste, to us, very valuable time, in reading letters of explanation or
writing notes of apology. _Not to mention_ the two postage stamps saved--a
consideration; since, by Poor Richard's rule of compound interest--

    "A penny saved is two pence got."

"MRS. BARNARD."--Let your children wear aprons, by all means. They are not
out of fashion; but, on the contrary, new patterns are constantly being
designed. See our fashion article for the present month.

"A NEW MAMMA" will find several editions of "Mother Goose" in the market.
One is contained in "Harry's Ladder to Learning," published by Evans &
Brittan, one of the best juveniles we know, as there are many excellent
things inclosed in its covers. It can also be had separate, postage and
all, for less than a quarter of a dollar. A more elaborate edition, as
full of clever designs as the Christmas-pie of little Jack Horner was
supposed to be of plums, is published by John Rund Smith, London, under
the title of the "Nursery Rhymes of England." Also imported by Evans &
Brittan.

"MISS A. B. L." can safely have her white and muslin dresses for the
ensuing season made with infants' waists. If her figure is small and
light, they cannot fail to be becoming; and, for quite young ladies, the
style never is out of date.

"MRS. P. L.," of Darien, Geo., can have her books by package or mail. We
add to our list for reading aloud, "An Attic Philosopher in Paris: being
the Journal of a Happy Man," published by the Appletons. Its tone is most
genial and pure, entirely free from the French sentimentality that borders
on frivolity, and, at the same time, full of pathetic truths. For the
children, we would particularly commend "Our Little Comfort" and "Love's
Lessons," both of which are admirable.

"MRS. H."--An infant's skirt should not be over a yard in length. Of
course, the petticoats should be a hem shorter, the flannel shortest of
all.

"MISS LIZZIE N."--See fashion article.

"ELLEN" had better send an order for patterns, now that they are so
cheap--much cheaper than _words_.

Of the work that "MRS. R." has asked our opinion as a book for the family,
we must be allowed to say that we do not consider its morality to be pure,
nor the sympathies it arouses womanly. Dwelling on such scenes cannot do
the general good that some critics seem to expect from it. We agree with
them that "ignorance is not virtue;" at the same time, there is much to be
dreaded in _familiarizing_ the innocent mind with the details of sin and
wickedness. "To the pure, all things are pure," again urges the specious
moralist; but, alas for our nature that it should be so! the seeds of
impurity are to be found in every earth-born mind, only too ready to be
developed. Poison the mind, the imagination, and you open the flood-gates
of innumerable temptations. Only too true is the lesson of a sterner
moralist--

    "Vice is a monster of such frightful mien,
    As, to be hated, needs but to be seen;
    But seen too oft, familiar with its face,
    We first endure, _then pity_--then embrace."

We may seem to speak warmly on the subject, and thus overstep our limits;
but books that wrong, under a pretence of virtue, are worst of all to be
dreaded. Our sex are more exposed to their influence than to any open
temptation. Books are to us companions. They lie under our pillows, and on
the empty seat beside us; they hide in our work-baskets, or under the sofa
cushion, to come forth at a moment's notice; while, with men, they have
but the passing notice of an idle hour.

CHITCHAT UPON NEW YORK AND PHILADELPHIA FASHIONS FOR APRIL.

The month of April with us is principally devoted to shopping; the changes
of dress do not begin to be general before May, although the preparations
are, of course, made at this time. The principal consideration of the
month would seem to be mantillas, scarfs, etc., bonnets, and the making up
of dresses.

For a large variety of styles, in the mantilla department, we are indebted
to Brodie, of New York, who ranks at the head of this manufacture. In
our next number, we shall give a more detailed account of his large
establishment, entirely devoted to cloaks, mantillas, and scarfs. And
here we are bewildered with the variety, in attempting to select for our
readers.

Although velvet is not in season, strictly speaking, we must notice a
scarf mantilla of royal purple, the rich and costly fabric being decorated
by embroidery, the design a heavy wreath of grape leaves, purple clusters,
and twining tendrils. They are shaded with exquisite art, the leaves and
tendrils in different stitches, the clusters in rich raised work, the
effect of which it is impossible to describe.

A bridal scarf of rich embroidery on a white ground, as pure as the bridal
dress itself, is one of the next most costly importations. No other house
uses so much embroidery as Brodie, and we are assured by him that the
French needle-work, exquisite as it is, can be excelled in this country.
His establishment alone affords employment to hundreds in this branch of
female industry, through the busy seasons of the year.

The woven embroidery now so much the style, where bouquets, wreaths, etc.,
are brocaded on a plain ground, is brought into service the present
season. The Oriental scarf we notice, as combining richness of material
and effect, with plainness of form and decoration. It has a deep border
of palm leaves in bright shades, gold predominating, on a plain ground of
royal purple; the heavy fringe is of the same hue. The form is the simple
close-fitting mantilla scarf.

Another style, destined to become a favorite from its richness of effect,
is composed of several flounces of black guipure lace on a plain silk,
deep blue, green, violet, brown, etc. The lower one, much deeper than
those on the body of the mantle, falls over the dress, and that next to
the row which forms the upper finish follows the curve of the shoulder.
There is a space between each the width of the lace, and the several rows
are headed by a box-plaited _ruche_ of narrow black satin ribbon. Another
style has bands of velvet ribbon an inch and a half in width, placed
lengthwise on the scarf, the ends falling over the flounce of lace below.
They are at a little distance apart, and each is encircled or edged by
a narrow row of lace placed on flat, giving an effect at once elegant
and novel, which it would be impossible to describe by words. These
are a few of the leading spring styles; and others less costly, and in
lighter fabrics, will be described in our extended notice of Mr. Brodie's
establishment.

For those who do not order their mantillas and scarfs from the city
direct, or who depend upon home manufacture, we would advise them to send
to Demorest, 67 Canal Street, a few doors from Brodie's, for a set of
patterns, and make them up according to the very accurate idea given by
his styles. Here, again, we have several new varieties, the establishment
also importing direct from Paris. One of very graceful shape has plaits at
the back, as in the cloaks of the past season, with a tablier, or scarf
front passing around and forming a deep collar on the shoulder. All the
mantillas of the season, be it remarked, are very low and open, to display
the collar, chemisette, etc. Another, of plainer scarf form, has a collar
pointed in front, and a shoulder-piece coming below it has the effect of a
double collar, ending in a bow of ribbon upon the shoulder. Still another,
especially suited for a matron, has a slight fulness in the back, which is
cut in the same piece as the front, coming into a very low pointed yoke
on the shoulder; the collar corresponds in form and style. All Madame
Demorest's patterns are made in tissue paper, fitting to the figure with
the same grace as the real garment, and the trimmings are imitated with
wonderful exactness.

For several new sleeves, we are also indebted to the same establishment,
although the season is too early to admit of a judgment as to what will be
the prevailing styles.

The bonnets are all very small, with open shallow brims and long low
crowns. The stiff round crown has entirely gone out, and the ingenuity of
the milliner is almost exhausted in draping this very necessary part of
the bonnet in the most graceful way. Dress, or drawn bonnets are made of
silk and crape, with a profusion of ribbon and lace; the bonnet itself
seems of little consequence, so that the crown has a good shape, and the
inside of the brim is gracefully decorated. Our fashionable ladies have
a remarkable air of _one-sidedness_ in this respect. For instance, a
large bow of pink ribbon, set high up on the right, and a drooping spray
of flowers on the left, connected by blonde or narrow laces of any kind.
In wreaths running around the face, one side is made heavier than the
other, and continued so to the forehead, or crosses it perhaps, instead
of the old-fashioned well-balanced bouquets on each side, connected by
narrow wreaths at the top. White is the prevailing color so far, with
crape flowers in purple, with bright green leaves, as lilacs, heartsease,
convolvulus, clusters of glycena, etc. etc. Delicate shades of pink,
green, violet, and blue are also seen; lace, either blonde or less costly
styles, is used in all.

Of ribbons for straw bonnets we have endless varieties of colors and
patterns, brocaded, plaided, and plain. For ourselves, we are no fanciers
of a ribbon that at a little distance looks like a strip of gay-colored
chintz; a rich, thick satin, or Mantua, of one shade, is always more
lady-like, and sufficient variety can be found in the different stripes,
pearlings, etc. Gold brocaded ribbons--by brocaded, we mean a raised
figure upon a plain ground--are more suitable for headdresses, or
evening-dress, than the street. They will be _entirely out_ of place on
a straw bonnet; as much so as a rich gimp or velvet trimming on a chintz
dress.

Silks, mousselines, and light spring cashmeres, indeed, any fabric of like
thickness, will be made, as in the past winter, with basques, closed all
around, over the hips, and without the rolling-collar at the bust, which
was so long the style. The sleeves will be worn decidedly larger at the
top, even when they are not intended for puffs or plaits. These open on
the inside of the arm, and require to have the seam set very far forward,
so as to have the opening fall away from the wrist. It is now the style to
face a silk sleeve far up with white Florence, and box-plait a white satin
ribbon about an inch in width around the inside edge, no matter as to what
the dress itself is trimmed with: it gives a very stylish finish. Ribbons,
galloons, and frills of the same are the favorite trimmings, which, in
all cases save black, should match the shade of the dress exactly. Black
silks are much worn this spring, with ribbon trimmings of deep purple,
blue, green, and even crimson; the flounces are bound in this style, and
the barque and sleeve trimmings correspond. Bows of ribbon, medium width,
either flat or with flowing ends, close the basque and sleeve openings on
most of the new silks, etc. Guipure lace is the richest and most costly
of all, and comes of every shade and width, ranging from 75 cents to $5
per yard. The galloons are rich, light, and fanciful; satin and velvet,
watered, pearled, etc.

Our May number, besides a more elaborate notice of Mr. Brodie's
establishment, will contain many items of great interest in this
department, as the openings are announced for an early day.

TO EXTRACT ESSENCES FROM FLOWERS.--Procure a quantity of the petals of any
flowers which have an agreeable fragrance, card thin layers of cotton,
which dip into the finest Florence or Lucca oil, sprinkle a small quantity
of fine salt on the flowers, and lay a layer of cotton and one of flowers
alternately, until an earthen vessel or wide-mouthed glass bottle is full.
Tie the top close with a bladder, then lay the vessel in a south aspect to
the heat of the sun, and in fifteen days, when uncovered, a fragrant oil
may be squeezed away from the whole mass, quite equal to the highly-valued

fire, and while in a melted state mix in the powder. Make pills of three

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
